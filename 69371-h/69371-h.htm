<h2>NOTE</h2>
</div>


<p>I have found it convenient, especially in Appendix A, to use the symbol
&lt; following a date, to indicate an uncertain date not earlier than that
named, and the symbol &gt; followed by a date, to indicate an uncertain
date not later than that named. Thus 1903 &lt; &gt; 23 would indicate the
composition date of any part of this book. I have sometimes placed the
date of a play in italics, where it was desirable to indicate the date
of production rather than publication.</p>

<p>The documents from J. R. Dasent, <i>Acts of the Privy Council</i>
(1890–1907), are reprinted by permission of the Controller of His
Majesty’s Stationery Office.</p>

<span class="subhed">ANONYMOUS WORK</span></h2></div>

<p>[Here I bring together, giving them the same treatment as the
individual works in ch. xxiii, pieces of which the authorship, as
regards the whole or a large part, is unknown or conjectural. They are
grouped as (A) Plays, (B) Masks, (C) Receptions and Entertainments. It
has been convenient, for the sake of classification, to include in the
third group a few which might alternatively have been brought into ch.
xxiii under the name of a part-author or describer.]</p>


<h3>A. PLAYS</h3>


<h4><i>An Alarum for London &gt; 1600</i></h4>

<p><i>S. R.</i> 1600, May 27. ‘Allarum to London’ is included in a
memorandum of ‘my lord chamberlens menns plaies Entred’ and noted as
entered on this day to J. Roberts (Arber, iii. 37).</p>

<p>1600, May 29. ‘The Allarum to London, provided that yt be not printed
without further Aucthoritie.’ <i>John Roberts</i> (Arber, iii. 161).</p>

<p>1602. A Larum for London, or The Siedge of Antwerpe. With the ventrous
actes and valorous deeds of the lame Soldier. As it hath been playde by
the right Honorable the Lord Chamberlaine his Seruants. <i>For William
Ferbrand.</i> [Prologue and Epilogue.]</p>

<p><i>Editions</i> by R. Simpson (1872), J. S. Farmer (1912,
<i>T.F.T.</i>), and W. W. Greg (1913, <i>M.S.R.</i>).</p>

<p>The play has been ascribed to Shakespeare by Collier, to Shakespeare
and Marston by Simpson, and to Lodge by Fleay, <i>Shakespeare</i>, 291,
but no serious case has been made out for any of these claims. Bullen,
<i>Marlowe</i>, 1, lxxiv, says that Collier had a copy with doggerel
rhymes on the t.p. including the line,</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
   <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Our famous Marloe had in this a hand,</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="p-left">which Bullen calls ‘a very ridiculous piece of forgery’.</p>


<h4><i>Albion Knight &gt; 1566</i></h4>

<p><i>S. R.</i> 1565–6. ‘A play intituled a merye playe bothe pytthy and
pleasaunt of Albyon knyghte.’ <i>Thomas Colwell</i> (Arber, i. 295).</p>

<p>Fragment in Devonshire collection.</p>

<p>[The t.p. is lost, but the seventeenth-century play lists (Greg,
<i>Masques</i>, xlvii) include an interlude called <i>Albion</i>. A
fragment on Temperance and Humility, conjecturally assigned by Collier,
i. 284, to the same play, is of earlier printing by thirty years or so
(<i>M.S.C.</i> i. 243).]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span></p>

<p><i>Editions</i> by J. P. Collier (1844, <i>Sh. Soc. Papers</i>, i. 55)
and W. W. Greg (1910, <i>M. S. C.</i> i. 229).&mdash;<i>Dissertations</i>:
M. H. Dodds, <i>The Date of A. K.</i> (1913, 3 <i>Library</i>, iv.
157); G. A. Jones, <i>The Political Significance of A. K.</i> (1918,
<i>J. G. P.</i> xvii. 267).</p>

<p>Collier suggests that this was the play disliked at court on 31 Dec.
1559, but, as Fleay, 66, points out, that would hardly have been
licensed for printing. Dodds thinks it motived by the Pilgrimage of
Grace (1536–7) and written shortly after.</p>


<h4><i>Alice and Alexis</i></h4>

<p>A fragment (to iii. 1) of a play on the loves of Alice and Alexis,
thwarted by Tanto, with an argument of the whole, is in <i>Douce
MS.</i> 171 (<i>Bodl.</i> 21745), f. 48<sup>v</sup>. The date ‘1604’ is scribbled
amongst the pages. The manuscript also contains sixteenth-century
accounts. There seems nothing to connect this with Massinger’s
<i>Alexius, or the Chaste Lover</i>, licensed by Herbert on 25 Sept.
1639 and apparently included in Warburton’s list of burnt plays (3
<i>Library</i>, ii. 232, 249).</p>


<h4><i>Alphonsus, Emperor of Germany &gt; 1636</i></h4>

<p><i>S. R.</i> 1653, Sept. 9. ‘A play called Alphonso, Emperor of
Germany, by John Poole.’ <i>H. Moseley</i> (Eyre, i. 428).</p>

<p>1654. The Tragedy of Alphonsus Emperour of Germany. As it hath
been very often Acted (with great applause) at the Privat house in
Black-Friers by his late Maiesties Servants. By George Chapman Gent.

<p><i>Editions</i> by K. Elze (1867) and H. F. Schwarz (1913), and in
collections of Chapman (q.v.).</p>

<p><i>Alphonsus</i> may reasonably be identified with the <i>Alfonso</i>
given before the Queen and the Elector Palatine at the Blackfriars on
5 May 1636 (Cunningham, xxiv). The ascription on the title-page to
Chapman is repeated therefrom by Langbaine who rejects that of Kirkman
in 1661 and 1671 (Greg, <i>Masques</i>, xlviii) to Peele, but the
intimate knowledge of German shown in the dialogue has led Elze and
Ward, ii. 428, to give Chapman a German collaborator, conceivably one
Rudolf Weckerlin of Würtemberg, who after a preliminary visit before
1614 settled permanently in England about 1624 and obtained political
employment, which he varied with literary exercises. Later critics
are inclined to reject Chapman’s authorship altogether, and the case
against it has been effectively put by E. Koeppel, <i>Quellen-Studien
zu den Dramen Chapman’s</i>, 78, and Parrott. The ascription to
Peele has been revived by Robertson, <i>T. A.</i> 123, and though
Parrott does not accept the full argument, he agrees in regarding
the play as originally of Peele’s date, possibly by him, with or
without a collaborator, and drastically revised at a later period,
perhaps by Weckerlin in 1636. Fleay, ii. 156, 311, also accepts Peele
and identifies the play with <i>Harry of Cornwall</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span> revived by
Strange’s for Henslowe on 25 Feb. 1592, but, as Greg (<i>Henslowe</i>,
ii. 151) points out, the character in <i>Alphonsus</i> is not Henry,
but Richard of Cornwall. It must be observed that no critic has noticed
the <i>S. R.</i> ascription to John Poole, which may quite well be the
origin of Kirkman’s ‘Peele’. Who John Poole was, I do not know.</p>

<p>‘Haphazard, the Vice’ is a character. The stage-directions name ‘the
stage’, ‘the scaffold’. A prologue addresses ‘lordings’; an epilogue
has a prayer for the queen, nobles, and commons. The play is not
controversial, but the tone is Protestant. Fleay, 61, thinks it a
Westminster play of 1563–4; but no Westminster play of 1563–4 is on
record. If Fleay means 1564–5, the Westminster play of that Christmas
was <i>Miles Gloriosus</i>. There is nothing but the initials to
identify the author with Richard Bower of the Chapel (q.v.), but
the suggestion is more plausible than that of Wallace, i. 108, who
gives the play to Richard Edwardes (q.v.), finding that the ‘R. E.’
subscribed to some of his manuscript poems is capable of being misread
‘R. B.’.</p>

<p>Jacob first claimed the authorship for Shakespeare. In spite of the
advocacy of Swinburne (<i>Study of Sh.</i>, 129) modern criticism
remains wholly unconvinced. The play has tragic merit, but it is not
of a Shakespearian character, and it is impossible to fit its manner,
before 1592, into any coherent theory of Shakespeare’s development.
More plausible is the case for Kyd, suggested by Fleay, ii. 28, who
puts the date as far back as 1585 on quite unreliable grounds of
improbable guess-work, and supported by Robertson, <i>T. A.</i> 151,
and elaborately argued by Crawford and Sykes. But Boas, <i>Kyd</i>,
lxxxix, thinks that the author was more likely an imitator of Kyd, and
opinion remains divided. Oliphant (<i>M. P.</i> viii. 420) suggests Kyd
and Marlowe, possibly with a third. The theme may also have been that
of the <i>Murderous Michael</i> played at court by Sussex’s in 1579.</p>

<p>This is pretty clearly a University play, and any connexion with the
<i>Hercules</i> of the Admiral’s men in 1595 is highly improbable. As
George Peele died in 1596, it seems difficult to identify him with
the Peleus of the MS. Bond thinks that ‘the styles of composition and
writing agree in placing a date before 1600 out of the question’.</p>

<p>Bullen suggests that the author was Chapman, and also thinks Tourneur
or Marston conceivable. He quotes Fleay’s opinion in favour of Field.
Fleay, ii. 319, withdraws Field and substitutes Dekker. He identifies
the play with the ‘King Charlemagne’ of Peele’s <i>Farewell</i> of 1589
(cf. s.v. Peele, <i>Battle of Alcazar</i>). Schoell makes an elaborate
case for Chapman, and thinks that the play might be <i>The Fatall Love,
a French Tragedy</i>, entered as his in <i>S. R.</i> on 29 June 1660,
and included, without author’s name, in Warburton’s list of burnt plays
(3 <i>Library</i>, ii. 231). A date later than 1584 is indicated by the
use of Du Bartas’s <i>Seconde Semaine</i> of that year. It may be added
that the style points to <i>c.</i> 1600 rather than <i>c.</i> 1590.</p>

that the play’s ‘Father was an Academician’.</p>

[Epilogue.]&mdash;<i>Dissertation</i>: G. C. Moore Smith, <i>The Date of C.
L.</i> (1909, <i>M. L. R.</i> iv. 268).</p>

<p>The play is described by Fuller, <i>Hist. of Cambridge</i> (1655), 156,
as given at Clare Hall in 1597–8. But J. S. Hawkins, in his edition of
Ruggle’s <i>Ignoramus</i> (1787), xvi, gives the alternative date 1599,
and this has now been confirmed by the discovery of manuscript annals
of Cambridge, probably by Fuller himself, with the entry, under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
academic year 1599–1600, ‘Aula Clarensis. Club Law fabula festivissima
data multum ridentibus Academicis, frustra Oppidanis dolentibus’. The
play is a satire on the townsmen, and especially the anti-gown mayor of
1599–1600, John Yaxley. Fuller says that the townsmen were invited to
the performance and made to sit it through, and that they complained
to the Privy Council, who first ‘sent some slight and private check to
the principall Actors therein’, and then, when pressed, said that they
would come to Cambridge, and see the comedy acted over again in the
presence of the townsmen. The fact that there is no record of these
letters in the extant register of the Council hardly disproves the
substance of Fuller’s story. Hawkins ascribed the play to Ruggle (q.v.)
on the authority of an eighteenth-century memorandum.</p>

<p>Subtle Shift ‘the vice’, Providence, and Rumour are among the

<p>Dyce ascribed the play to George Peele on the strength of a manuscript
note ‘in a very old hand’ on a copy of the 1599 edition. Bullen
thinks it of earlier date than Peele. Greg agrees, regarding it as
about contemporary with <i>Common Conditions</i>. L. Kellner, in
<i>Englische Studien</i>, xiii. 187, compares the language and style
at great length with Peele’s and concludes against his authorship,
unless indeed he wrote it in a spirit of parody. His arguments are
challenged by R. Fischer in <i>Englische Studien</i>, xiv. 344. Fleay,
70, assigned it, with <i>Common Conditions</i>, to R. Wilson. Later
(ii. 295), he substituted R[ichard] B[ower]. He noted a parallel to
Thomas Preston’s <i>Cambyses</i>, and suggested as a date 1570 or
1578, the years, according to him, of the original production and of a
revival of <i>Cambyses</i>. G. L. Kittredge, in <i>Journal of Germanic
Philology</i>, ii. 8, suggests that Preston himself was the author
of <i>Sir Clyomon and Clamydes</i>. If the ‘her Maiesties Players’
of the title-page means the later company of that name, the play, if
not written, must have been revived 1583–94. Fleay, ii. 296, further
identifies it with <i>The Four Kings</i> licensed for Henslowe (i. 103)
in March 1599; but an old Queen’s play would not have needed a licence.
An Anglo-German repertory of 1626 includes a ‘Tragikomödie vom König in

<p>The authorship was first ascribed to Shakespeare (with that of <i>Edw.
IV</i> and <i>Edw. II</i>!) in Rogers and Ley’s play-list of 1656
(Greg, <i>Masques</i>, lxiv). The theory was advocated by Capell, and
has received much support, largely owing to the assent of Tennyson,
against whose authority, however, may be set that of Swinburne. In its
latest and not altogether unplausible form, Shakespeare is regarded
as the author, not of the whole play, but of i. 2 and ii, which deal
with the episode of the wooing of Lady Salisbury by the king, and are
possibly, although by no means certainly, due to another hand than that
of the chronicle narrative, to which they are only slightly linked.
The style of these scenes is not demonstrably un-Shakespearian, and
they, and in less degree the play as a whole, contain many parallels
with <i>Hen. V</i> and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span> other works of the ‘nineties, of which the
repetition in <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i. 451 and in Sonnet <span class="allsmcap">XCIV</span> of the

<p class="p-left">is the most striking. The controversy cannot be dealt with in detail
here. Shakespeare’s contribution, if any, may with most probability
be assigned to the winter of 1594–5; but it does not follow that the
original play may not have been of earlier date. No importance is to
be attached to the argument of Fleay (ii. 62; <i>Shakespeare</i>, 282)
that the use of the phrase ‘Ave, Caesar’ in <span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i. 164 caused
its use in Greene’s <i>Francesco’s Fortunes</i> of 1590 (cf. App.
C, no. xliii), but it is noteworthy that a play on the subject was
produced, apparently under Anglo-German influence, at Danzig in 1591
(Herz, 5). Of non-Shakespearian authors, for the whole or a part of the
play as extant, Marlowe is preferred by Fleay, Greene by Liebau and
Robertson, and Kyd by Sarrazin.</p>

Soc.</i>).&mdash;<i>Dissertation</i>: A. Sander, <i>T. Heywood’s Historien
von König Edward iv und ihre Quellen</i> (1907, Jena diss.).</p>

<p>Sander and others date the play 1594, by an identification with the
anonymous <i>Siege of London</i> revived by the Admiral’s on 26 Dec.
1594. Greg (Henslowe, ii. 173) more cautiously says that the play
of 1594 ‘may underlie’ certain scenes of <i>1 Edward iv</i>. He
regards <i>Edward iv</i>, ‘on internal evidence, as unquestionably
Heywood’s’. This is the usual view, but Fleay, ii. 288, had doubted
it. There is no external evidence for Heywood’s authorship, or for
any connexion between him and Derby’s men. Moreover, in May 1603, he
authorized Henslowe, on behalf of Worcester’s, to pay Chettle and Day
for ‘the Booke of Shoare, now newly to be written’, also described
as ‘a playe wherein Shores wiffe is writen’. If this was a revision
of his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span> play, he would hardly have left it to others. It is fair
to add that in the previous January he had himself received payment
with Chettle for an unnamed play, which might be the same (Henslowe,
ii. 234). The ‘three-mans song’ on Agincourt in iii. 2 of Part I
closely resembles Drayton’s <i>Ballad of Agincourt</i> (ed. Brett,
81), and must, I think, be his. <i>Jane Shore</i> is mentioned as a
play visited by citizens in <i>The Knight of the Burning Pestle</i>
(1607), ind. 57, and ‘the well-frequented play of Shore’ in <i>Pimlyco
or Runne Redcap</i> (1609). A play, apparently on the same subject, was
performed by English actors at Graz on 19 Nov. 1607 (Herz, 98).</p>

<p>Fleay, ii. 321, suggests a date <i>c.</i> 1602 on the ground of
apparent reference to the <i>Poetomachia</i>. But this is not
conclusive, and Adams points to the use of a song (p. 335) from
Bateson’s <i>Madrigals</i> (1604). He thinks that Lewis Machin was
the author, as the style resembles that of the comic part of <i>The
Dumb Knight</i> (vide s. Markham), and two passages are substantially
reproduced in the latter. If so, this also may be a King’s Revels
play. Allusions on p. 270 to the ‘babones’ (cf. s.v. <i>Sir Giles
Goosecap</i>) and on p. 316 to the Family of Love (cf. s.v. Middleton)
are consistent with a date of 1603–8.</p>

<p>The play has a double plot. One theme is the contest of William the
Conqueror and the Marquess Lubeck for the loves of Princess Blanch of
Denmark and of Mariana, a Swedish captive; the other is the contest
of Manvile, Mountney and Valingford for Em, daughter of the Miller of
Manchester. A ‘ballad intituled The Miller’s daughter of Manchester’
was entered on the Stationers’ Register by Henry Carr on 2 March 1581
(Arber, ii. 390). <i>Fair Em</i> has been included<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span> in the Shakespeare
<i>Apocrypha</i> on the strength of a volume formerly in the collection
of Charles II, and then in that of Garrick, in which it was bound
up with <i>Mucedorus</i> and <i>The Merry Devil of Edmonton</i> and
lettered ‘Shakespeare, vol. i’. On the other hand, Edward Phillips, in
his <i>Theatrum Poetarum</i> (1675), assigned it to Greene. Clearly
Greene is not the author, although there are certain resemblances of
situation between the play and <i>Friar Bacon</i>; for he satirizes it
in the preface to <i>Farewell to Folly</i> (<i>Works</i>, ix. 232),
quoting one or two of its expressions and blaming them as borrowed out
of Scripture. Of the author he says, ‘He that cannot write true English
without the help of clerks of parish churches will needs make himself
the father of interludes’, and, ‘The sexton of St. Giles without
Cripplegate would have been ashamed of such blasphemous rhetoric’.
<i>Farewell to Folly</i> seems to have appeared in 1591 (cf. s.v.
Greene), and <i>Fair Em</i> may perhaps therefore be dated between
this pamphlet and <i>Friar Bacon</i> (<i>c.</i> 1589). Simpson adopts
the theory, which hardly deserves serious discussion, of Shakespeare’s
authorship. He finds numerous (but impossible) attacks by Greene upon
Shakespeare from the <i>Planetomachia</i> (1585) onwards, and thinks
that Shakespeare retorted in <i>Fair Em</i>, satirizing Greene as
Manvile and Marlowe as Mountney, and depicting himself as Valingford.
‘Fair Em’ herself is the Manchester stage. In the story of William the
Conqueror he finds an allusion to the travels of William Kempe and
other actors in Denmark and Saxony. Fleay, <i>Shakespeare Manual</i>
(1878), 281, adopts much of this fantasy, but turns ‘Fair Em’ into the
Queen’s company and Valingford into Peele. In 1891 (ii. 282) he makes
‘Fair Em’ Strange’s company. His minor identifications, whether of 1878
or of 1891, may be disregarded. More plausible is his suggestion that
the author of the play may be Robert Wilson (q.v.), which would explain
the attack upon Greene (q.v.) for his <i>Farewell to Folly</i> in R.
W.’s <i>Martin Mar-sixtus</i> (1591). The suggestion that the play
was the <i>Sir John Mandeville</i> revived by Strange’s for Henslowe
in 1592 rests on a confusion between Mandeville and Manvile, but it
may have been the <i>William the Conqueror</i> similarly revived by
Sussex’s on 4 Jan. 1594 (Greg, <i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 151, 158).</p>

the theory of Collier that this was Day’s <i>Bristol Tragedy</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
written for the Admiral’s in May 1602, on the grounds that it is not
a tragedy and does not resemble the known work of Day. Moreover, the
King’s men are not likely to have acquired an Admiral’s play.</p>

attempts a compromise by giving ii. <span class="allsmcap">I</span>, iv. <span class="allsmcap">I</span>, and

<p>The epistle says ‘I commende to your freendly viewe this prettie
Conceit, as well for the inuention, as the delicate conueiance thereof:
not doubting but you will so esteeme thereof, as it dooth very well
deserue, and I hartely desire’. This praise of the ‘conueiance’ (which
I take to mean either ‘style’ or possibly ‘translation’) does not
suggest that M. A. (or A. M.) was the translator. It is true that
ll. 224–41 appear in <i>England’s Helicon</i> (1600) signed ‘Shep.
Tonie’, and that this signature is often taken to indicate Munday. On
the other hand, two lines of this passage also appear in <i>England’s
Parnassus</i> (1600, ed. Crawford, 306) over the initials S. G., which
suggest Gosson. Another passage in <i>E. P.</i> (231) combines ll.
661–2 and 655–6 of the play over the signature G. Chapman. This has
led Crawford (<i>E. S.</i> xliii. 203), with some support from Greg,
to suggest Chapman’s authorship. I do not think the suggestion very
convincing, in view of the inconsistency and general unreliability of
<i>E. P.</i> and the fact that Chapman’s first clear appearance as a
writer is ten years later, in 1594. The evidence is quite indecisive,
but of Munday, Chapman, Gosson, I incline to think Gosson the most
likely candidate. On the other hand, if M. R. is Matthew Roydon, he was
the dedicatee of poems by Chapman in 1594 and 1595. For M. A. I hardly
dare guess Matthew Arundel. In any case, the play is only a translation
from L. Pasqualigo’s <i>Il Fedele</i> (1576).</p>

<p>Sussex’s men revived the play for Henslowe on 29 Dec. 1593 (Greg,
<i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 158). The Chatsworth copy has on the title-page
the following notes in two early seventeenth-century hands: ‘Written
by ... a minister, who ac[ted] the piñers p̄t in it himself. Teste
W. Shakespea[re]’, and ‘Ed Iuby saith that the play was made by Ro.
Gree[ne]’. These, though first produced by Collier, appear (<i>M.
S. C.</i> i. 288) to be genuine. Greene’s authorship has been very
commonly accepted. Fleay, i. 264, ii. 51, supposed first Greene and
Peele, then added Lodge, but, although the text has been abridged,
there is no evidence of double authorship. Oliphant’s suggestion (<i>M.
P.</i> viii. 433) of revision by Heywood only rests on the inclusion of
the play next his in the Cockpit list of 1639 (<i>Variorum</i>, iii.
159). R. B. McKerrow thinks (<i>M. S. C.</i> i. 289) that the ‘by Ro.
Greene’ of the note may mean ‘about Ro. Greene’ as a leading incident
is apparently based on an episode of Greene’s life. An allusion in

<p>Bullen thought the author, who is stated in Perry’s epistle to be dead
in 1636, might be some imitator of Chapman. Fleay, ii. 322, suggests
Chapman himself. This view receives elaborate support from Parrott, and
appears very plausible. As ‘your greatest gallants, for men, in France
were here lately’ (<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. 47) the date is after the visit of
Biron in Sept. 1601 and possibly after that of Nevers in April 1602.
It cannot be later than the beginning of 1603, as ‘She is the best
scholar of any woman, but one, in Europe’ (<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i. 140) points
to Elizabeth’s lifetime. Moreover, Dekker, in his <i>Wonderful Year</i>
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span> 1603 (Grosart, i. 116), has ‘Galen could do no more good, than Sir
Giles Goosecap’, and though ‘goosecap’ is a known term for a booby,
e.g. in Nashe’s <i>Four Letters Confuted</i> of 1592 (<i>Works</i>,
i. 281), the play seems to be responsible for the ‘Sir Giles’. The
phrase ‘comparisons odorous’ in <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> ii. 64 echoes <i>Much
Ado</i>, <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> v. 18. The later part of the period 1601–3 would
perhaps best fit the allusions to the Family of Love (<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i.
263), as to which cf. s.v. Middleton’s play of that name, and to the
baboons (<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i. 11), the memory of which is still alive in
<i>Volpone</i> (1606) and <i>Ram Alley</i> (1607–8). Probably these
had already amused London before 1605, as on Oct. 5 of that year the
Norwich records (Murray, ii. 338) note that ‘This day John Watson
ironmonger brought the Kyngs maiesties warrant graunted to Roger
Lawrence &amp; the deputacion to the seid Watson to shewe two beasts called
Babonnes’. So, too, Kelly, 247, has a Leicester payment of 1606 ‘to the
M<sup>r</sup> of the Babons, lycensed to travell by the Kings warrant’. There
is a story of a country fellow who wanted to go to a market town ‘to
haue seene the Baboones’ as late as J. Taylor’s <i>Wit and Mirth</i> in
1629 (Hazlitt, <i>Jest Books</i>, iii. 43). Fleay’s identifications of
Chapman himself with Clarence and Drayton with Goosecap hardly deserve
consideration.</p>

<p>Of I. T. nothing is known. Greg (<i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 213) regards the
play as clearly of the sixteenth century on internal evidence, and
points out that Henslowe, on behalf of the Admiral’s, paid Haughton 5s.
on 6 May 1600, ‘in earneste of a boocke which he wold calle the devell
&amp; his dame’. The entry was subsequently cancelled, and presumably
Haughton transferred the play to another company. Sykes calls attention
to analogies with <i>Englishmen for my Money</i>, which confirm the
probability of Haughton’s authorship. It is only the ascription of
1662 to I. T. which causes hesitation. Farmer (<i>Hand List</i>, 19)
suggests that this was John Tatham. Grim and the Devil both appear
in the <i>Like Will to Like</i> of Ulpian Fulwell (q.v.), but I do
not understand what kind of indirect connexion Greg thinks may have
existed between Haughton’s play and a possible revival of Fulwell’s by
Pembroke’s men in Oct. 1600.</p>

<p>In <i>Tarlton’s Jests</i> (ed. Halliwell for <i>Sh. Soc.</i> 24) is a
story of Knell acting Henry V and Tarlton doubling the parts of the
judge and the clown, which clearly refers to this play. The performance
took place ‘at the Bull in Bishopsgate’. Tarlton died in 1588. Fleay,
67; ii. 259, suggests that Tarlton was the author. Nashe in <i>Pierce
Penilesse</i> (1592, <i>Works</i>, i. 213) speaks of ‘<i>Henrie</i> the
fifth represented on the stage’. This is obviously too early to be the
new play of ‘harey the V’, given thirteen times for Henslowe between
28 Nov. 1595 and 15 July 1596 by the Admiral’s, in whose inventories
of March 1598 Harry the Fifth’s doublet and gown appear. An earlier
Henslowe entry on 14 May 1592, sometimes quoted as ‘harey the v<sup>th</sup>’
by Collier, is really ‘harey the 6’ (Greg, <i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 152,
177; <i>Henslowe Papers</i>, 121). Sykes thinks the author S. Rowley
(q.v.).</p>

<p>Fleay, ii. 69, gives the whole play to Marston, but the sounder view
of Simpson that Marston, whose style in places is unmistakable, was
only the reviser of an earlier play, is revived in the elaborate and
mainly satisfactory study of Small, 67. The passages assigned by Small
to Marston are ii. 63–9, 128–9, 247–79; iii. 179–v. 191; v. 234; vi.
259–95. I should be inclined to add v. 244–67, but to omit ii. 128–9;
iii. 218–64; iv. 159–201; v. 61–102; v. 147–180; vi. 259–95, which may
just as well belong to the original play. No doubt vi. 259–95 is an
addition, constituting an alternative ending for a court performance
before Elizabeth; but this may just as well have been a contemporary
as a Marstonian addition, and in fact there is no court performance at
the end of the century available for it, while the attempt to find one
led Fleay to the impossible theory that it was given by Derby’s men.
As its whole substance is a satire on professional players, it must
have been both produced and revived by amateurs or boys; and the same
conclusion is pointed to by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span> enormous number of characters. The
original matter is so full of the technical learning of the schools
as to suggest an academic audience; I think it was a University or
possibly an Inns of Court, not a choirboy, play. The theme is the
cyclical progression of a state through the stages Peace, Plenty,
Pride, Envy, War, Poverty, and Peace again. It is illustrated by the
fortunes of a company of players, who wax insolent in prosperity, and
when war comes, are pressed for soldiers. Their poet Posthaste is
clearly Munday and not, as Simpson and others have vainly imagined,
Shakespeare. With him is contrasted the scholar-poet, Chrisoganus, a
philosopher with whom the players will have nothing to do. He seems to
belong to the order of ideas connected with the scientific school of
Thomas Harriott. Small thinks that the date was 1596, when there was
scarcity of food, a persecution of players, and a pressing of men for
service against Spain; and that the author might be Chapman. Certainly
Chapman was an early admirer of Harriott. But I disagree as to the
date. The style seems to me to be that of Peele or some imitator,
the attitude to the players an academic reflection of the attacks of
Greene, and the political atmosphere that of the years following the
Armada, when the relief of peace was certainly not unbroken by fears of
renewed Spanish attempts. Impressment was not a device of 1596 alone.
The only notice of it known to me in which players are known to have
especially suffered is in an undated letter of Philip Gawdy, assigned
by his editor to 1602 (Gawdy, 121), ‘All the playe howses wer besett
in one daye and very many pressed from thence, so that in all ther ar
pressed ffowre thowsand besydes fyve hundred voluntaryes, and all for
flaunders’. This is too late for the <i>proto-Histriomastix</i>, and
probably also for the revival, but men were being pressed for foreign
service as early as 1585, and again in 1588 and possibly in 1589 and
1591 (Cheyney, i. 158, 197, 219, 255; <i>Procl.</i> 805, 809). As to
the revival, Small puts it definitely in August 1599, when a scare of
a Spanish invasion, which had lasted for a month, came to a crisis
in London on Aug. 7 (Stowe, <i>Annales</i>, 788; Chamberlain, 59;
<i>Sydney Papers</i>, ii. 113; <i>Hist. MSS.</i> xv, app. v, 66), and
he thinks that the words ‘The Spaniards are come!’ (v. 234) are an
insertion of this date. They are not ‘extra-metrical’, as Fleay says,
for the passage is not in metre. There had, however, been earlier
scares, e.g. in Oct. 1595 (<i>Sydney Papers</i>, i. 355; cf. Arber,
iii. 55, 56) and in Oct. 1597 (<i>Edmondes Papers</i>, 303). The
date of 1599 would agree well enough with the career of Marston, and
with that of the Paul’s boys, to whom the revival was probably due,
although I do not agree with Small that it was their court play of 1
Jan. 1601, because I see no evidence that the court ending belongs
to the revision. I take it that <i>Histriomastix</i> was one of the
‘musty fopperies of antiquity’ with which we learn from <i>Jack Drum’s
Entertainment</i>, v. 112, that the Paul’s boys began. The revision
leaves Posthaste untouched, save for the characteristic Marstonian
sneer of ‘goosequillian’ (iii. 187). Munday of course was still good
sport in 1599. But Chrisoganus is turned from a scientific into a
‘translating’ scholar (ii. 63). I agree with Small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span> that Marston has
given him Jonsonian traits, and that he intended to be complimentary
rather than the reverse. I do not know that it is necessary to suppose
that Jonson misunderstood this and took offence, for the real offence
was given by <i>Jack Drum’s Entertainment</i> in the next year. But
certainly some of the ‘fustian’ words put in the mouth of Clove in
<i>Every Man Out of His Humour</i>, <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. 177 sqq., later in
1599 come from <i>Histriomastix</i>, and their origin is pointed by the
phrase ‘as you may read in Plato’s Histriomastix’. One of the fragments
of plays recited by the players contains the lines (ii. 269):</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">

<p class="p-left">I am not convinced with Small that this belongs to the revision, even
though it seems discontinuous with the following fragment of a Prodigal
Child play. But in any case the hit at Shakespeare, if there really
is one, remains unexplained. There is nothing else which points to so
early a date as 1599 for his <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>. I note the
following parallel from S. Rowlands, <i>The Letting of Humors Blood in

<p>The B.M. copy of 1602 (C. 34, b. 53) has the note ‘Written by Ioshua
Cooke’ in ink on the title-page. Presumably the author of <i>Greene’s
Tu Quoque</i> (q.v.) is meant, with which Swaen, xiii, declares that
the play shows ‘absolutely no similarity or point of agreement’.
Fleay, i. 289, suggested an ascription to Heywood on the ground of
parallelisms with <i>The Wise Woman of Hogsdon</i>, and this case is
elaborately and plausibly argued by Swaen and Adams. The date must be
before Worcester’s begin to appear in Henslowe’s diary, 17 Aug. 1602.
Fleay’s attempt to twist its mentions of a certain ‘Thomas’ in the text
(l. 790) into references to Heywood himself and Thomas Blackwood, the
actor, is mere childishness.</p>

<p>The play has come to light since the issue of <i>The Mediaeval
Stage</i>, and I therefore include it here, although it is
pre-Elizabethan. The characters are Peace, Envy, Impatient Poverty
(afterwards Prosperity), Conscience, Abundance, Misrule, ‘Collhasarde’,
and a Summoner. The drama is a moral, non-controversial, and not even
necessarily Protestant in tone. It sets out the mutability of the world
and the defects of poverty and prosperity. The scene is a ‘place’,
and there are allusions to Newgate and Tyburn. If the T. R. of the
title-page is the same whose name is at the end of <i>Nice Wanton</i>,
the play is probably not later than the reign of Edward VI; but the
Summoner and allusions to penance and courts spiritual suggest an
even earlier date. The final address to the ‘Soueraynes’ contains the
following stanza:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
   <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Let vs pray al to that lorde of great magnificence</div>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span></p>

<p class="p-left">The form of the companion stanzas suggests that the two last lines
originally rhymed, and that a line has dropped out before them.
Possibly an ending originally meant for Henry VIII and Jane Seymour
has been altered with a view to making it appropriate to Elizabeth.
The play is offered with other pre-Elizabethan plays by the company
in <i>Sir Thomas More</i>, <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> i. 42, and was also in the
obsolete library of Captain Cox (<i>Robert Laneham’s Letter</i>, ed.

<p><i>Editions</i> by R. Simpson (1878, <i>S. of S.</i> ii. 125) and J. S.
Farmer (1912, <i>T. F. T.</i>).</p>

<p>All critics have recognized the style as Marston’s and some of the
vocabulary is vomited in <i>Poetaster</i>; cf. Small, 93. The date is
fixed to 1600 by allusions to hopes of ‘peace with Spaine’, ‘Kemps
morice’, and ‘womens yeare’ (i. 37, 45, 166). There is little doubt
that the critical Brabant Senior is Jonson, and that the play is that
in which he told Drummond that Marston staged him. The cuckolding of
Brabant Senior is based upon a story narrated by Jonson to Drummond
(Laing, 21) as one in which he had played the active, not the passive,
part. If he had imparted the same story to Marston, he not unnaturally
resented the use made of it. The minor identifications suggested by
Fleay, ii. 74, have nothing to commend them, except possibly that of
Sir Edward Fortune with Edward Alleyn, who was building the Fortune in
1600. Were not this a Paul’s play, one might infer from the closing
line,</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">

  </div>

<p class="p-left">that it was given at the Fortune. Can the Admiral’s have shared it with
Paul’s, as the Chamberlain’s shared <i>Satiromastix</i>? In iv. 37–48
Brabant Senior criticizes three ‘moderne wits’ whom he calls ‘all apes
and guls’ and ‘vile imitating spirits’. They are Mellidus, Musus, and
Decius. I take them to be Marston, Middleton, and Dekker, all writers
for Paul’s; others take Decius for Drayton, to whom Sir John Davies
applied the name, and Musus, by a confusion with Musaeus, for Chapman
or Daniel. For v. 102–14, which bears on the history of the company,
cf. ch. xii (Paul’s).</p>

<p>Fleay, ii. 153, Schütt, and Robertson, 121, all incline to suggest the
authorship, whole or in part, of Peele. Schütt would date <i>c.</i>
1588, but the theme is that of T. Nelson’s pageant of 1590–1, for which
year a member of Walworth’s company, the Fishmongers, was Lord Mayor.
The text of the play is very short, with only four acts.</p>

<p><i>Editions</i> in Dodsley<sup>4</sup> (1874, ii), and by J. S. Farmer (1908,

<p>The play must necessarily, from the date of the S. R. entry, be
pre-Elizabethan, and should have been included in Appendix X of
<i>The Mediaeval Stage</i>. C. C. Stopes, <i>Hunnis</i>, 265, and in
<i>Athenaeum</i> (28 April 1900), claims the authorship for Hunnis; W.
Bang has suggested Udall, which seems plausible. The parts of Mido and
Abra point to boy-actors.</p>

<p>The ascription by Fleay, ii. 27, and Sarrazin to Kyd is rejected on
stylistic grounds by R. Fischer, <i>Zur Kunstentwicklung der Englischen
Tragödie</i>, 100, with whom Boas and other writers concur. A reference
to the jubilee of 1600 (<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i. 25) points to a date at the
beginning of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span> the seventeenth century. If so, the play cannot be that
revived by Strange’s for Henslowe in Feb. 1592 and given, sometimes
under the title of <i>Don Horatio</i>, and sometimes under that of the
<i>Comedy of Jeronimo</i>, during a run of, and several times on the
night before, the <i>Spanish Tragedy</i> (Greg, <i>Henslowe</i>, ii.
150, 154). It is, moreover, not a comedy. It may, however, be a later
version of the same theme, motived by another revival of the <i>Spanish
Tragedy</i> by the Admiral’s in 1601–2. If so, it was probably itself
due, not to the Admiral’s, but to the Chamberlain’s, and a piracy of
their property by the Revels boys explains the jest at ‘Ieronimo <i>in
decimo sexto</i>’ in the induction to the 1604 version of Marston’s
<i>Malcontent</i>. It must be uncertain whether <i>1 Jeronimo</i> was
the ‘Komödie vom König in Spanien und dem Vice-Roy in Portugall’ given
at Dresden in 1626 (Herz, 66, 76).</p>

describes the MS. which contains the Latin text of the <i>Judithae
Constantia</i> of Cornelius Schonaeus, of which a reprint was issued

<p>Strange’s men produced ‘the Knacke to Knowe a Knave’ on 10 June 1592,
and played it seven times to 24 Jan. 1593. Henslowe usually enters it
as ‘the cnacke’. Fleay, 100, suggests that the <i>Osric</i>, revived
by the Admiral’s men on 3 and 7 Feb. 1597, may also be this play.
Both Fleay, ii. 310, and Greg, <i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 156, suggest that
Kempe’s ‘merriments’ are to be found in sc. 12, and that of the rest
the romantic part may be Peele’s and the moral part Wilson’s.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span> Gayley
(<i>R. E. C.</i> i. 422) would like to find in the play the comedy
written by Greene and the ‘young Juvenall’, Nashe. The character
Cuthbert Cutpurse the Conicatcher is from the pamphlet (cf. s.v.
Greene) entered in S. R. on 21 April 1592, and the story of Titus

<p>The Queen’s and Sussex’s revived ‘kinge leare’ for Henslowe on
6 and 8 April 1594, shortly before the first S. R. entry (Greg,
<i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 162). As the play is not named in the Sussex’s
repertory of 1593–4, there is a presumption that it belonged to the
Queen’s. The authorship is quite obscure. Fleay, 90, assigns it to
Lodge and Peele; Fleay, 97, to Lodge and Greene; Fleay, ii. 51, to
Lodge and Kyd. Robertson, 176, thinks the claim for Lodge indecisive,
and surmises the presence of Greene. Sykes argues for Peele. Lee hints
at Rankins. The publishing history is also difficult. The entries of
1605 appear to ignore White’s copyright, although this was still alive
in his son’s widow in 1624. Lee suggests that the Stafford-Wright
enterprise was due to negotiation between Wright and White, whose
apprentice he had been. The play was clearly regarded as distinct from
that of Shakespeare, which was entered to N. Butter and J. Busby on
22 Nov. 1607, and it, though based on its predecessor, is far more
than a revision of it. It seems a little improbable that <i>Leire</i>
should have been revived as late as 1605, and the ‘Tragecall’ and
‘lately acted’ of the title-page, taken by themselves, would point to
an attempt by Stafford to palm off the old play as Shakespeare’s. But
although 1605 is not an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span> impossible date for Shakespeare’s production,
1606 is on other grounds more probable.</p>

<p>A reference to ‘childish yeeres’ in the prologue points to boy actors.
The trial (l. 1261) is for an alleged crime on 4 Feb., 43 Eliz. (1601),
and the next court performance after this date was on 22 Feb. 1601 by
the Chapel, to which occasion the production may be assigned. Elizabeth
could be described as a ‘prince’, so that the use of this term does not
bear out Fleay, ii. 323, in assuming a revival of an Edwardian play,
but the characters are mainly abstract and the style archaic for the
seventeenth century, and it is conceivable that the <i>Prodigality</i>
of 1567–8 had been revived.</p>

<p>The interpretation of the W. S. of the title-page in F<sub>3</sub> of 1664 as
indicating Shakespeare may be accurate, but does not suggest anything
more than revision for a revival, or perhaps only for the press. Some
revision is proved by the allusion in the epilogue to Elizabeth,</p>

<p class="p-left">an allusion which was not chronologically accurate until
the close of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span> the thirty-eighth regnal year on 16 Nov. 1596, after
the play was in print, and could hardly have been made before the
beginning of that year on 17 Nov. 1595, after it had been entered in
S. R. As to the original author, one is bound to be sceptical of the
unconfirmed notice by J. P. Collier (<i>Bibliographical Account</i>, i.
95) of an ‘inscription on an existing copy of the play ... assigning
the authorship of it to Charles Tylney’. This, says Collier, ‘is the
handwriting of Sir George Buck. He adds the information that he himself
had written the dumb shows by which it was illustrated, and that it
was originally called <i>Elstrild</i>’. Charles Tilney was a cousin
of the Master of the Revels, and was executed for complicity in the
Babington plot in 1586 (Camden, <i>transl.</i> 303). The statement,
if true, would give an early date to the play, which the dumb shows
and other ‘Senecan’ characteristics have been supposed to confirm.
Fleay, ii. 321, boldly conjectures that the epilogue originally
referred to ‘eight and twentie yeares’, and that the play was ‘by’
in the sense of ‘about’, Tilney, supposing the moral drawn against
‘ciuill discord’ instigated by ‘priuate amours’ to point at Mary of
Scots. Recent investigations, however, concerning the relations of the
play to Spenser on the one hand, and to <i>Selimus</i> (q.v.) on the
other, suggest a date not earlier and not much later than 1591, either
for the original composition of the play, or for a very substantial
revision of it. Most of the points are well summed up by Cunliffe in
<i>C. H.</i> v. 84. <i>Locrine</i> may borrow historical facts from
the <i>Faerie Queene</i> (1590); it does not borrow phrases from it.
It does, however, borrow phrases and whole lines, with more than
Elizabethan plagiarism, from Spenser’s <i>Complaints</i> (1591). There
is also an apparent loan from Wilmot’s <i>Tancred and Gismund</i>
(1591). Some of the <i>Complaints</i> passages are also borrowed by
<i>Selimus</i>, which makes similar booty both of <i>Locrine</i>
itself and of the <i>Faerie Queene</i>. I agree with Cunliffe that
the evidence is clearly in favour of <i>Selimus</i> being the later
of the two plays, but am not so certain that the second borrowing of
the <i>Complaints</i> passages tells against a common authorship of
the two. It would be so, ordinarily, but here we have to do with an
abnormal plagiarist. Whoever the author, he belongs to the school of
the university wits. Marlowe is preferred by Malone, Peele by Fleay,
Ward, Gaud, and for all but the comic scenes by Hopkinson, Greene by
Brooke, Peele and Greene by Robertson.</p>

<p>Shakespeare’s authorship is accepted by few modern critics. An
exception is Hopkinson. Fleay, <i>Shakespeare</i>, 299; <i>B. C.</i> i.
152, thinks that he may have ‘plotted’ the play, but that the writer
is the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span> as that of <i>Thomas Lord Cromwell</i>, whom he believes
to be Drayton. Perhaps he is right in regarding an allusion to service
‘under the king’ (<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i. 16) as pointing to a Jacobean date.
Brooke suggests Marston or Dekker. A play ‘von einem ungehorsamen
Khauffmanns Sohn’ appears in Anglo-German repertories of 1604 and 1606
(Herz, 65, 94).</p>

<p>At the end of the play Gloucester proposes to fight the Saracens in
Portugal, and as Anthony Wadeson (q.v.) was writing <i>The Honourable
Life of the Humorous Earl of Gloster with his Conquest of Portugal</i>
in June or July 1601, it has been suggested by Fleay, ii. 267, and
Greg, <i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 204, that Wadeson was also the author of
<i>Look About You</i>. The play ought itself to appear somewhere in
Henslowe’s diary, and Fleay may be right in identifying it with the
<i>Bear a Brain</i> of 1599, although the only recorded payment for
that play was not to Wadeson, but to Dekker. There are reminiscences of
<i>R.J.</i> <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> iv. 42; <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> v. 221 in l. 2329, and

<p>Fleay, ii. 26, assigns the play to Kyd on account of the similarity
of the plot to that of <i>Soliman and Perseda</i>, but this is hardly
convincing. On 30 Dec. 1582 Derby’s players performed <i>A History of
Love and Fortune</i> at court, for which a city and battlement were
provided by the Revels office. If the two plays were identical, as
dates and style make not improbable, the city presumably served as a
background for the scenes at court, while the battlement was used for
the presenters Venus and Fortune, who are said in Act I to be ‘set
sunning like a crow in a gutter’.</p>

<p>The text is a fragment, but there may have been more, as the original
fly-leaves and end papers of the volume are gone. Sir G. F.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span> Warner
thinks the hand ‘quite early seventeenth century’. The corrections in
the same hand are such as rather to suggest an original composition,
but may also be those of an expert copyist. Miss Daw thinks that the
date of composition was in the seventeenth century, and that the
play represents ideas belonging to (<i>a</i>) the Anabaptists and
(<i>b</i>) the Family of Love, both of which were then active. She even
suggests the possible authorship of the controversialist Edmond Jessop.
Personally, I find it difficult to assign to the seventeenth century
a moral written precisely in the vein of the middle of the sixteenth
century, even to the notes (2, 69, 103) of action ‘in place’ (cf. ch.
xix), and a phrase (76),</p>

<p class="p-left">closely parallel to <i>Wit and Wisdom</i>, 12, which is probably
pre-Elizabethan. The Jacobean activity of Anabaptism and Familism only
revived movements which had been familiar in England from Edwardian
times, were particularly vigorous in 1575, and had apparently died down
during the last decade of Elizabeth’s reign; cf. for Anabaptists C.

<p>Archer’s play list of 1656 (Greg, <i>Masques</i>, lxxxvi) started an
ascription to Lyly, which was probably suggested by the similarity of
name to <i>Love’s Metamorphosis</i>. Daniel, with Lyly as reviser,
is substituted by Fleay, ii. 324; Day by Gosse and Bullen; Day, with
Lyly as reviser, by Bond. A limit of date is given by the reopening of
Paul’s in 1599, and <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> i. 157 points to the ‘leape yeare’
1600. Fleay thinks that the play was performed at Anne Russell’s
wedding on 16 June 1600 (cf. ch. <span class="allsmcap">V</span>), but, though ‘three or
foure Muses’ dance at the end of the play, there is no indication of a
mask, while the accounts of the wedding say nothing of a play.</p>

proposes to identify this with the <i>Wit and Will</i> played at court
in 1567–8 (cf. App. B), as Will is a character.</p>


<h4><i>Meleager</i> (?)</h4>

<p>B. Dobell, in <i>Athenaeum</i> for 14 Sept. 1901, described a MS.
in his possession with the title A Register of all the Noble Men of
England sithence the Conquest Created. The date of compilation is
probably 1570–90. On f. 3 is the argument in English of a play headed:</p>

<p class="p-left">Presumably the play was in English also. It was classical in manner

<p>Moseley’s attribution was repeated in the play lists of Archer in
1656 and Kirkman in 1661 (Greg, <i>Masques</i>, lxxxix), and the play
was bound with <i>Mucedorus</i> and <i>Fair Em</i> as ‘Shakespeare,
vol. i’ in Charles II’s library. The attempt of Fleay, ii. 313 (cf.
his <i>Shakespeare</i>, 294), to show that Sir John the priest was
originally called Oldcastle and gave a name to the play is too
far-fetched, but it leads him to support a tradition originally based
on a note by Coxeter (<i>Dodsley</i><sup>2</sup>, v. 247) that the author was
Drayton. He puts it in 1597, apparently because Jessica calls Lancelot
a ‘merry devil’ in <i>M. V.</i> <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> iii. 2. But the Host is
pretty clearly copied from him of the <i>Merry Wives</i> (<i>c.</i>
1599), and allusions to the king’s hunting (<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> i. 158,
186), although perhaps merely part of the historic action, might also
have been topical under James I. The play existed by 1604, when it is
mentioned in T. M.’s <i>Black Book</i> (Bullen, <i>Middleton</i>, viii.
36). Jonson calls it ‘your dear delight’ in the prologue to <i>The
Devil is an Ass</i> (1616), and it was revived at court on 3 May 1618
(Cunningham, xlv).</p>

G. L. Kittredge, <i>The M. and Laurence Johnson</i> (1901, <i>J. G.
P.</i> iii. 335).</p>

<p>Brandl, following Collier, ii. 368, 378, dates the play in 1560, on the
ground of an allusion in <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> i. 131 to ‘the rising rection
ith north’, i.e. the Pilgrimage of Grace of 1536, as twenty-four
years before the time of action, but it is not quite clear that the
rambling dialogue of rustics, in which the passage occurs, justifies
the interpretation put upon it; nor is the allusion in <span class="allsmcap">III.</span>
ii. 3 to the weathercock of Paul’s, set up in 1553 and destroyed in
1561, any more conclusive, as the phrase may have become proverbial.
The style might be either of <i>c.</i> 1560 or, in a provincial play,
of <i>c.</i> 1577, or, as Bond suggests, a reviser of <i>c.</i> 1577
might have revised a text of ten or twelve years earlier. For author,
Fleay, 16, 58, 60, taking the piece to be that disliked at court on
31 Dec. 1559, offered Richard Edwardes, and is followed by Wallace,
i. <span class="allsmcap">III</span>. There is nothing to suggest that the play was ever
performed at court at all. It seems more natural to look for him,
either in the Thomas Richards or in the Laurence Barjona of the MS.
Conceivably Richards might be the T. R. whose initials appear on
the prints of <i>Impatient Poverty</i> and <i>Nice Wanton</i> (cf.
<i>Mediaeval Stage</i>, ii. 460) in 1560. Barjona might be the name of
a converted Jew. But Kittredge regards it as an anagram of Johnson,
and points out that a Laurence Johnson matriculated at Christ’s
College, Cambridge, in 1570, and took his B.A. in 1574 and his M.A. in
1577, while a Thomas Richards of Trinity took his B.A. in 1571, and
a Thomas Ward of Jesus in 1580. A reference to Cambridge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span> learning
(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> iii. 74) does not, of course, go far to prove Cambridge
authorship. Anyway, the Barjona of the title-page is probably the
‘Laur. Bariona’ who signed, also from Kettering, the epistle to a
book called <i>Cometographia</i> on 20 Jan. 1579. It is the work of
an Anglican; not therefore of the Laurence Johnson, who was an Oxford
Jesuit. I can add a few facts. A Laurence Jonson, with one Chr. Balam
and George Haysyll of Cambridge, made a complaint through Lord North to
the queen against the Bishop of Ely in Dec. 1575 (<i>S. P. D. Eliz.</i>
cv. 88). This is interesting, because George Haysell of Wisbech was
apparently one of Worcester’s players (cf. ch. xiii) in 1583. There
is also a Laurence Johnson who on 12 June 1572 wrote to Lord Burghley
about his service in the Mint (<i>S. P. D. Eliz.</i> lxxxviii. 17);
possibly the same of whom Burghley wrote to his ‘brother’ William
Herlle on 3 April 1575, that he could do nothing for him (<i>S. P. D.
Eliz.</i> ciii. 24). Finally a Laurence Johnson engraved plates in 1603
(<i>D. N. B.</i>).</p>


<h4><i>Sir Thomas More c. 1596</i></h4>

<p>[<i>MS.</i>] <i>B.M. Harleian MS.</i> 7368. [The wrapper is endorsed,
‘The Booke of Sir Thomas Moore’, and is in part composed of a vellum
leaf also used for that of Munday’s <i>John a Kent and John a
Cumber</i>. The character of the damp stains on the two MSS. shows
that they must for some time have lain together. Two passages of the
original text have disappeared, and six passages have been inserted,
on fresh leaves or slips, to replace these and other cancelled matter.
One of these leaves appears to have been misplaced. Greg finds seven
distinct hands: (<i>a</i>) the writer of the original text, whom he
has now identified (<i>M. L. R.</i> viii. 89) with Munday; (<i>b</i>)
five contributors to the insertions, of whom one appears also to have
acted as a playhouse corrector, another (writing 30 lines) seems
clearly to be Dekker, and a third (writing 148 lines) has been taken
(v. <i>infra</i>) for Shakespeare; (<i>c</i>) the Master of the Revels,
Edmund Tilney, who has given some directions as censor, of which the
most important, at the beginning, runs: ‘Leaue out the insurrection
wholy &amp; the Cause ther off &amp; begin with S<sup>r</sup> Tho: Moore att the mayors
sessions with a reportt afterwardes off his good service don being
Shriue off London vppon a mutiny Agaynst the Lumbardes only by A
shortt reporte &amp; nott otherwise att your own perrilles E. Tyllney’.
Whether Greg is right in calling this a ‘conditional licence’ I am not
sure, but he corrects earlier writers by pointing out that the extant
insertions do not carry out Tilney’s instructions, and were probably
made before the play reached him. Although therefore the appearance
of an actor’s name in a s.d. suggests that the play was cast for
performance, it is not likely that it was actually performed, at any
rate in its present state.]</p>

<p>The play has been dated <i>c.</i> 1586 and <i>c.</i> 1596, in both of
which years there were disturbances with some analogy to the ‘Ill May
Day’ of the plot, and an early date has been regarded as favoured by
mentions (ll. 1006, 1148) of Oagle a wigmaker, since men of the name
were serving the Revels Office in this and similar capacities from
1571 to 1585 (Feuillerat, <i>Eliz., passim</i>), and by the appearance
as a messenger in a stage-direction (Greg, p. 89) of T. Goodal, an
actor traceable with Berkeley’s men in 1581 and with the Admiral’s
or Strange’s in the plot of <i>The Seven Deadly Sins</i>, <i>c.</i>
1590–1. But Goodal may have acted much longer, and the Admiral’s men
had business relations with a ‘Father Ogell’ in Feb. 1600 (Greg,
<i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 300). Greg, after comparing Munday’s script in the
play with other and better datable examples of that script, inclines to
put it ‘between 1596 and 1602, say 1598–1600’, and Sir E. M. Thompson,
on a further review of the same evidence, suggests 1592 or 1593.
This, however, involves putting the MS. of <i>John a Kent and John a
Cumber</i> (cf. ch. xxiii, s.v. Munday) back to 1590, which, although
palaeographically possible, is inconsistent with evidence pointing
to its production by the Admiral’s in 1594. Certain parallels with
<i>Julius Caesar</i> and <i>Hamlet</i> might suggest the latter part
of the possible period, although the parallel suggested by Schücking
with Fletcher’s <i>The Tamer Tamed</i> is too slight to bear out his
date of 1605–8, and the attempt of Fleay (ii. 312; <i>Shakespeare</i>,
292) to identify the play with the <i>Abuses</i> of Paul’s in 1606 is
guess-work. Jonson’s apparent debt to <i>S. T. M.</i> in <i>Bartholomew
Fair</i>, pointed out by Baskervill, is also in favour of a latish
date. Obviously the mention of ‘Mason among the Kings players’ (l.
1151) does not prove a Jacobean date, as Henry VIII had players. No
actor of the name in either reign is known, although an Alexander Mason
was marshal of the royal minstrels in 1494 (Collier, i. 45). Account
must be taken of the support given by Sir E. M. Thompson to the theory
of R. Simpson and Spedding that three of the added pages are in the
hand of Shakespeare. This is based on a minute comparison with the
few undoubted fragments, almost entirely signatures, of Shakespeare’s
writing. Both hands use ‘the native English script’ and are ‘of an
ordinary type’, without marked individual character ‘to any great
extent’, although slight peculiarities, such as ‘the use of the fine
upstroke as an ornamental adjunct to certain letters’, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span> common to
them. The demonstration would have been more convincing had the hands
been less ‘ordinary’, but Sir E. M. Thompson’s authority is great,
and some support is furnished by P. Simpson from the character of the
punctuation in the addition, and by J. D. Wilson from some orthographic
resemblances to the more reliable Shakespearian quartos. Sir E. M.
Thompson’s views are criticized in G. Greenwood, <i>Shakespeare’s
Handwriting</i> (1920). If Shakespeare was the author, the analogies
between the matter of the addition and the Jack Cade scenes of <i>Henry
VI</i> would be in favour of an earlier date, if that were possible,
than 1596 or even 1594, although I should not like to be committed to
the view that Shakespeare might not have scribbled the fragment at
any time in the sixteenth century. On a balance of the mixed literary
and palaeographical evidence before us, the safest guess seems to be
1596. As to the rest of the authorship, Dr. Greg’s discoveries point
to Munday, with some help from Dekker. Fleay’s argument (<i>Sh.</i>
292) for Lodge and Drayton is flimsy. If Shakespeare had a share, the
company was probably the Chamberlain’s. Goodal’s name proves nothing as
to this.</p>

<p>It is difficult to date with precision the revival for which the
additions printed in the Q. of 1610 (1610/1?) were written, especially
as the genuineness of the Q. of 1609, in which Collier stated that he
found these additions, cannot be verified, since the accounts of the
Treasurer of the Chamber do not specify the exact days on which the
numerous appearances of the King’s men at court during the winters of
1608–9, 1609–10, and 1610–11 took place. The conjecture of Fleay (ii.
50; <i>Shakespeare</i>, 303) that the additions date from 1606 was
largely based on a guess that they appeared in the Q. of 1606, which
he had not seen. The added or altered passages are the prologue; i.
1, 2; iv. 1; parts of v. 2; and the final lines of the induction. The

is also an allusion in his <i>Love Restored</i> of 6 Jan. 1612. If
so, the revival must have been on Shrove Sunday, 3 Feb. 1611. In

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span></p>

<p>Fleay, with 1606 in his mind, finds here an apology for <i>The Fox</i>,
thinking Jonson the raven and <i>Eastward Hoe</i> the ‘trap for Boyes’.
In 1610 there had been no trouble about any London play, although one
in Lincolnshire had given offence. But a careful reading of the passage
will show that it is no apology at all, but a boast, and an attack upon
informers against the stage.</p>

<p>As the play had been in print since 1598, it must not be assumed
that, because the King’s revived it in 1610–11, it was originally a
Chamberlain’s play. It may have belonged to the Queen’s or some other
extinct company. Evidently it was a popular play, as the number of
editions shows. <i>K. B. P.</i> ind. 91 tells us that Ralph has ‘play’d
... Musidorus before the Wardens of our Company’.</p>

<p>The ascription to Shakespeare is due to Archer’s list of 1656 (Greg,
<i>Masques</i>, xci) and to the inclusion of the play with <i>Fair
Em</i> and <i>The Merry Devil of Edmonton</i> in a volume in Charles
II’s library, lettered ‘Shakespeare, vol. i’ (<i>Variorum</i>, ii.
682). It now receives little support, even as regards the added
passages. Greene is preferred as the original author by Malone and
Hopkinson, Peele by von Friesen, and Lodge by Fleay.</p>

<p>After the suppression of the theatres in 1642, <i>Mucedorus</i> was
acted by strolling players in various parts of Oxfordshire. An accident
during a performance at Witney on 3 Feb. 1654 is recorded in John Rowe,
<i>Tragi-Comoedia. Being a brieff relation of the strange and wonderful
hand of God, discovered at Witney in the Comedy acted February the
third, where there were some slaine, many hurt and several other
remarkable passages</i> (1653/4).</p>

<p>Either <i>Mucedorus</i> or Greene’s <i>Alphonsus</i> (q.v.) may have
been the play on a king of Arragon given at Dresden in 1626. It has
also been suggested (Herz, 95) that <i>Mucedorus</i> influenced Pieter
Hooft’s Dutch pastoral <i>Granida</i> (1605).</p>

<p>The porter’s name is Francis, and from some speeches and a letter
composed for him, which appear in the same manuscript, it is clear that
he was Francis Clark, who became porter of St. John’s, Oxford, on 8 May
1601, at which house therefore the play was doubtless given. It has
borrowings from <i>M. N. D.</i> and <i>1 Hen. IV.</i></p>

<p>A moral of Protestant controversy, with typical personages, bearing
allegorical names, arranged for four actors.</p>

<p>The final prayer is for Elizabeth, and Avarice played in the days of
Queen Mary. Fleay, 64; ii. 294, thinks it a revised Edward VI play, on
the ground of an allusion to a ‘square caps’ controversy of 1550. But
this was still vigorous in 1565 (cf. Parker’s <i>Letters</i>, 240).
Fleay also says that the <i>Nugize</i> of Captain Cox’s collection
(Laneham, 30) is <i>Mankind</i> (<i>Med. Stage</i>, ii. 438) in which
New Gyse is a character. But <i>Mankind</i> was first printed in 1897,
and probably this play is the one Laneham had in mind.</p>

<p>The play is probably Jacobean. There is a reference to the unwilling
recipients of knighthood (l. 325), and the use of Essex’s nickname
for Cobham, Sycophant, as the name of a courtier, must be later than
Cobham’s disgrace in 1603. Simpson thought that an allusion to the
misuse of the collections for rebuilding Paul’s steeple (l. 754)
pointed to an original date <i>c.</i> 1592, when the matter caused a
scandal, but the steeple was still unbuilt in James’s reign. Greg,
<i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 230, revising a conjecture of Fleay, i. 293,
suggests that <i>Albere Galles</i>, written by Heywood and Smith for
Worcester’s in Sept. 1602, may be this play, and Henslowe’s title a
mistake for <i>Archigallo</i>, one of the characters. The play seems to
have reached Germany by 1608. A performance at Graz in that year was
probably the occasion of the dedication by ‘Joannes Grün Nob. Anglus’
to the archduke Maximilian of a manuscript German translation, now in
the Rein library. To it is attached a coloured drawing of a bearded man
in a doublet which hides his breeches, and with a book and chain in his
hands. Above is written ‘Nemo’ and ‘Neminis Virtus ubique Laudabilis.’
A version is also in the Anglo-German collection of 1620 (Herz, 66,
112).</p>

<p>There are several notes of time and authorship. At the end of 1,
which was ‘three daies studie’ (l. 3), the pilgrimage has lasted ‘4
yeares’ (712). Kinsader’s, i.e. Marston’s, <i>Satires</i> and Bastard’s
<i>Epigrams</i>, both of 1598, are mentioned (212). The prologue to 2,
which is a ‘Christmas toy’ (18), deprecates the former courtesy of ‘our
stage’:</p>

  </div>

<p>It is now seven years since the scholars started for Parnassus (62).
Gullio has been ‘verie latelie in Irelande’ and ‘scapt knightinge’
(878), obviously with Essex in 1599. The <i>Epigrams</i> (1599) of ‘one
Weaver fellow’, i.e. John Weever, are alluded to (982). The prologue to
3, also a ‘Christenmas toy’ (30), calls it ‘an old musty show, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
hath laine this twelue moneth in the bottome of a coalehouse’ (25).
‘The Authors wit’ (48) has stood ‘hammering upon ... 2 schollers some
foure (1606, whole) yeare’ (37). This is the third play of a series
(76):</p>

  </div>

<p><i>Belvedere</i> (1600) is published (179) and Nashe is dead (314).
The Dominical letters are C, or for the Annunciation year D and C
(1105), and the moon is in ‘the last quarter the 5 day, at 2 of the
cloke and 38 minuts in the morning’ (1133). These indications fit Jan.
1602 (Lühr, 15, 105). The siege of Ostend, which extended from 1601 to
1604, has begun (1333). Jonson has ‘brought vp Horace giving the Poets
a pill’ (1811), and Kempe is back ‘from dancing the morrice over the
Alpes’ (1823). Both events took place in 1601. It is still Elizabeth’s
reign (1141).</p>

<p>A quite clear conclusion as to date is not possible. The calendar
references, the four years of hammering (in 3), and the probability
that the writer would try to have his allusions to literary events up
to date, suggest performances at the Christmases of 1598–9, 1599–1600,
and 1601–2. This allows for a twelve-months’ delay, followed by a good
deal of revision, in the performance of 3. On the other hand, the
difference between four (in 1) and seven (in 2) years of pilgrimage
points to 1598–9, 1601–2, and 1602–3. On the whole, I lean to the first
alternative.</p>

<p>So far as we know, the association of Kempe with the Chamberlain’s men
was out of date either in 1601 or 1602; conceivably he returned to the
company for a while in 1601, but he was certainly of Worcester’s in
1602.</p>

<p>Moore Smith thinks that the ‘ruder quill’ of the prologue to 3 implies
that the author of 2 and 3 was distinct from the author of 1. But the
same prologue speaks clearly of a single author. Hales took the account
of his troubles in getting his degree literally, and pointed out that
foreign students at German universities were called ‘Käsebettler’
and ‘Käsejäger’. Moore Smith doubts, and thinks the degree may have
been given at Cambridge by the influence of William Holland, senior
fellow of St. John’s, and his name glanced at in ‘Germanie’. The
absence alike of matriculation books and college admission registers
for the period makes identification difficult. Corney found a copy of
the print of 3 with the inscription ‘To my Lovinge Smallocke J. D.’,
which he thought in the same hand as the <i>Lansdowne MS.</i> of John
Day’s <i>Peregrinatio Scholastica</i>. Bullen was inclined to support
Day’s authorship on internal grounds, but Day was a Caius man, whose
university career closed in disgrace, and is not very likely to have
written plays for St. John’s some years later. And it is but a slight
connexion with Cheshire that ‘dey’ means ‘dairy’ in the dialect of that
county. Cheshire ought to be our clue. Charles Chester was not, so far
as I know, a writer. Hales seems to have thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span> that the theatrical
Beestons of London may have been connected with the Cheshire family of
that name. There was a Cheshire foundation at St. John’s, and Moore
Smith cites a suggestion that the author may have been William Dodd, a
Cheshire man, who became Scholar of St. John’s in 1597, B.A. in 1599,
and Fellow in 1602. The ‘priviledge’ reminds me of the traditional
jurisdiction of the Dutton family over minstrelsy in Cheshire
(<i>Mediaeval Stage</i>, ii. 259), but I do not know whether any Dutton
can be traced at St. John’s.</p>

<p>In i. 2 of 3 Judicio is exercising the occupation of a ‘corrector
of the presse’, apparently in the employment of a particular
printing-house, not of the licensing authorities. The house would be
Danter’s, who is himself introduced in i. 3 bargaining with Ingenioso
to give him 40s. for a pamphlet. In iv. 3 Burbage and Kempe appear, and
here is the famous passage in which Kempe says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Few of the vniuersity men pen plaies well, they smell
too much of that writer <i>Ouid</i>, and that writer
<i>Metamorphosis</i>, and talke too much of <i>Proserpina &amp;
Iuppiter</i>. Why heres our fellow <i>Shakespeare</i> puts them
all downe, I and <i>Ben Ionson</i> too. O that <i>Ben Ionson</i>
is a pestilent fellow, he brought vp Horace giuing the Poets a
pill, but our fellow <i>Shakespeare</i> hath giuen him a purge
that made him beray his credit.’</p>
</div>

<p>Fleay, <i>Shakespeare</i>, 221, suggests that the ‘purge’ was the
description of Ajax in <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, <span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii.
15, and is supported by Small, 167. If so, it was very irrelevant to
its setting. The purge ought to be <i>Satiromastix</i>, and though
there is nothing to indicate that Shakespeare had any responsibility
for <i>Satiromastix</i>, it is just conceivable that a Cambridge
man, writing before the play was assigned to Dekker in print, may
have thought that he had. The allusion is clearly to Shakespeare as
a writer, or one might have thought that he acted Horace-Jonson in
<i>Satiromastix</i>.</p>

<p>Especially in 3, the writer is much occupied with contemporary
literature, but this does not justify the slap-dash attempt of Fleay,
ii. 347, to identify nearly all his characters with individual literary
men. They are, of course, not individuals, but types, and types
of university men. The most that can be said is that there may be
something of Marston in Furor Poeticus, and a good deal of Nashe, with
probably also a little of Greene, in Ingenioso, who ultimately takes
flight, with Furor and Phantasma, to the Isle of Dogs (v. 3, 4):</p>

<p>The preliminary matter of 1602 and 1633 is shown by Greg,

Sir Edward Dymocke as the translator. He may be a John Dymmocke, to
whom Archer’s play-list of 1656 (Greg, <i>Masques</i>, xcvi) assigns
in error <i>The Faithful Shepherdess</i>. The translation is from

<p>The analogies of title and date of publication to <i>The Cobler’s

<p>This has been ascribed to Robert Sempill (1530?-95), but merely because
his play before the Regent of Scotland on 17 June 1568 (Diary of Robert
Birrel in Dalyell, <i>Fragments of Scottish History</i>, 14) is not
otherwise known. R. Brotanek (1898, <i>Festschrift zum viii allgemeinen

<p>The W. S. of the title-page was interpreted as William Shakespeare in
Archer’s play-list of 1656 (Greg, <i>Masques</i>, c). The attribution
is accepted by no modern critic, and guesses at Wentworth Smith and
William Smith rest similarly on nothing but the initials. Internal
evidence points to an author who was an Oxford man, and familiar with
the plays of Shakespeare. Middleton is preferred by Fleay, ii. 92,
Bullen (<i>Middleton</i>, i. lxxix), and others; Marston by Brooke,
who dwells on a general resemblance to <i>Eastward Hoe</i>, and seems
inclined to think that Jonson, whose <i>Bartholomew Fair</i> the play
foreshadows, might also have contributed. The character George Pyeboard
is clearly meant for Peele, and the play uses episodes which appear in
<i>The Merrie Conceited Jests of George Peele Gent</i>. This, though
the extant print is of 1607, was entered in S. R. on 14 Dec. 1605. The
Paul’s plays seem to have terminated in 1606, and Fleay points out that
an almanac allusion in <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> vi. 289 is to Tuesday, 15 July,
which fits 1606. The attack on the Puritan ministers was resented in W.
Crashaw’s Paul’s Cross sermon of 13 Feb. 1608 (cf. App. C, no. lvi).</p>

<p>The authorship is ascribed to ‘Tournour’ in Archer’s list of 1656
and to ‘Cyril Tourneur’ in Kirkman’s lists of 1661 and 1671 (Greg,
<i>Masques</i>, cii). Fleay, ii. 264, is sceptical, thinking the work
too good for the author of <i>The Atheist’s Tragedy</i>, and inclined
to suggest Webster. Oliphant (<i>M. P.</i> viii. 427) thinks Tourneur
impossible, in view of the difference of manner, and suggests, only to
reject, Middleton. E. E. Stoll, <i>John Webster</i>, 107, 212, points
out that both plays are much under the influence of Marston, and that
the date may be fixed by the borrowing of the name and character of
Dandolo from <i>The Fawn</i> (1606).</p>

Phil.</i> iii. 138); F. S. Boas, <i>A Seventeenth Century Theatrical
Repertoire</i> (<i>Library</i> for July 1917).</p>

<p>The play deals with an earlier part of the reign than that of
Shakespeare’s <i>Richard II</i>. Keller concludes from a study of
parallel passages that it was known to Shakespeare, and that the
author knew Marlowe’s <i>Edward II</i> and <i>2 Henry VI</i>. This
gives a date of about 1592–5. Fleay, ii. 320, dates the play about
1591 and assigns it, for no apparent reason, to the Queen’s men. Boas
accepts the date 1590–5 on internal evidence, but finds the names
‘George’ and ‘Toby’ in the stage-directions as players of servants’
parts, and supposes the MS. to belong to a seventeenth-century revival
and to have been collected with others in <i>Egerton MS.</i> 1994 by
the younger William Cartwright, who was one of a late King’s Revels
company traceable during 1629–37 (Murray, i. 279). He identifies
‘George’, rather hazardously, with George Stutfield, who belonged to
this company, and ‘Toby’ with an Edward Tobye, who is not known to
have belonged to it, but is found in 1623 among the Children of the
Revels to the late Queen Anne (Murray, i. 361; ii. 273). My difficulty
about this is that the relation of <i>1 Rich. II</i> to Shakespeare’s
play is so close as to make it natural to regard it as having become
a Chamberlain’s play, and therefore unlikely to get into the hands of
either of these Revels companies. Any company might have a George.
George Bryan, for example, is a possibility. Toby, no doubt, is a rarer
name. Toby Mills died in 1585, but might have left a son or godson of
his name.</p>

<p>Collier, <i>Shakespeare</i>, v. 342, put the play earlier than 1588 on
the ground that the epilogue in praise of Elizabeth makes no mention
of the Armada. But ‘She hath put proud Antichrist to flight’ may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
pass for such a mention. Fleay, 64, dates it about 1587: in ii. 28 he
says ‘1586 or late in 1585’ as a ballad on the subject was entered on
the Stationers’ Register on 15 Aug. 1586; in ii. 315 he prefers 1591,
regarding the play as a continuation of <i>The Contention between
York and Lancaster</i>. He considers a later date as excluded by the
close of the court career of the Queen’s men in 1591. This, however,
did not close until 1594, and the epilogue was not necessarily
given at court. Churchill also thinks the play a continuation of
the <i>Contention</i>, and finds influences, not very striking, of
Marlowe’s <i>Tamburlaine</i>, <i>Faustus</i>, and <i>Edward II</i>.
He concludes for 1590–1. There is very little trace of any use by
Shakespeare of this play for his <i>Richard III</i>.</p>

<p>Boswell groundlessly took the author to be that of <i>Locrine</i>
(q.v.). Fleay, ii. 315, tries to divide the scenes between Lodge and
Peele, and suggests that they were re-writing Kyd.</p>

<p>The play, which deals with the episodes of Robin Hood and the Friar and
Robin Hood and the Potter, is appended to a reprint of the narrative
<i>Geste</i>, originally printed by Wynken de Worde. Manly assigns
Copland’s edition to <i>c.</i> 1550, but Arber, v. 32, to ‘<i>c.</i>
1560, by the Printer’s address’, and Furnivall, <i>Captain Cox</i>,
to <i>c.</i> 1561. Apparently Copland is not traceable at the Three
Cranes before that year and had earlier addresses. If so, I think that
his anonymous entry of 1560 in the Stationers’ Register may fairly be
supposed to relate to <i>Robin Hood</i>.</p>

<h4><i>The Second Maiden’s Tragedy. 1611</i></h4>

<p>[<i>MS.</i>] <i>B.M.</i>, <i>Lansdowne MS.</i> 807, f. 29, formerly
<i>penes</i> John Warburton. [Greg distinguishes four contemporary
hands: (<i>a</i>) a scribe or copyist of the original text and certain
additions on inserted slips; (<i>b</i>) a corrector, probably the
author; (<i>c</i>) the Master of the Revels, Buck; (<i>d</i>) a
theatre official, who added stage-directions. The contributions of
(<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) are not wholly distinguishable, especially
where mere deletions are in question, as the author may, besides
literary corrections, have made others due to the hints, or known
views, of Buck as censor. The presence of a second literary corrector
is just possible. On the verso of the last leaf Buck has written: ‘This
second Maydens tragedy (for it hath no name inscribed) may w<sup>th</sup> the
reformations bee acted publikely. 31 octob<sup>r</sup>. 1611. G. Buc.’ In later
hands are the title ‘The Second Maydens Tragedy’ at the beginning, and
a note following Buck’s endorsed licence, which originally ran, ‘The
Second Maydens Tragedy October 31<sup>th</sup> 1611 By Thomas Goffe A Tragedy
indeed’. Here Goffe’s name has been cancelled, and two successive
correctors have substituted, firstly, ‘George Chapman’, and then ‘By
Will Shakspear’. Warburton’s hand is not discernible, and the last
correction was probably made after his time, as his list of manuscript
plays (3 <i>Library</i>, ii. 232) includes ‘2<sup>d</sup>. p<sup>t</sup>. Maidens Trag̃.
Geo. Chapman’.]</p>

Nicholson, <i>The S. M. T.</i> (1912, <i>M. L. N.</i> xxvii. 33).</p>

<p>The play may be assigned to the King’s men, in view of stage-directions
to ll. 1724, 1928, which show that ‘M<sup>r</sup> Goughe’ played Memphonius and
‘Rich Robinson’ the Lady. Perhaps this also explains the ascription
of authorship to Thomas Goffe, which, like those to Chapman and
Shakespeare, now finds no favour. Tieck, who translated the play in his
<i>Shakespeare’s Vorschule</i> (1829, ii), argued for Massinger, whose
lost <i>Tyrant</i> he took the play to be. No doubt the chief character
is only entitled ‘Tyrant’ in the manuscript. But the <i>Tyrant</i> has
a separate existence both in S. R. and in Warburton’s list. Fleay,
ii. 331, thought that the title was originally meant to be <i>The
Usurping Tyrant</i>, and that the play was by the author of <i>The
Revenger’s Tragedy</i>, generally assigned to Tourneur. Rosenbach
doubts Massinger, and thinks Tourneur’s hand traceable. Swinburne seems
to have suggested Middleton.</p>

(1899, Kiel diss.); cf. s. <i>Locrine</i>.</p>

<p>The T. G. of the 1638 title-page is probably meant for Thomas Goffe,
the author of contemporary plays on Turkish history. He, however, was
only born in 1591. Six passages from the play are assigned to Greene in
R[obert] A[llot’s] <i>England’s Parnassus</i> (1600). This is fairly
strong evidence, and Greene’s authorship is supported by Grosart,
Brooke (<i>Sh. Apocrypha</i>, xix), and Gilbert. Ward and Gayley (<i>R.
E. C.</i> i. 420) take the opposite view. Crawford, who points out
(<i>E. P.</i> xxxv, 407) that Allot is not impeccable, prefers Marlowe.
Fleay, ii. 315, would divide the play between Greene and Lodge. The
problem is bound up with that of the authorship of <i>Locrine</i>
(q.v.), from which <i>Selimus</i> clearly borrows. It can therefore
hardly be of earlier date than 1591. The Conclusion, or epilogue,
promises a second part, of which nothing is known.</p>

<p>Fleay, ii. 26, Sarrazin, and Boas claim the play for Kyd, partly
on grounds of style, partly because the plot is an elaboration of
the ‘play within the play’ of <i>The Spanish Tragedy</i> (<i>c.</i>
1589), iv. 4; Wiehl doubts on metrical grounds. Schick (<i>Archiv</i>,
xc) suggests Peele, who is said in the <i>Merry Conceited Jests</i>
(Bullen, <i>Peele</i>, ii. 389) to have written, or pretended to have
written, a play of <i>The Knight of Rhodes</i>, a title which would
apply to <i>Soliman and Perseda</i>. Robertson, 109, 150, 166, thinks

<p>‘Tom Stucley’ is named as a stage hero by Peele in his <i>Farewell</i>
(1589); but the present play is probably the <i>Stewtley</i> produced
by the Admiral’s on 11 Dec. 1596 (Greg, <i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 181).
There are allusions to ‘the Theatre fields’ (611) and ‘her Majesty’
(752), which may only represent historic time. Although Sebastian of
Portugal is a character, there is no reference to the legend of his
survival, which was well known in England in 1598. Simpson regards
the play as belonging to the Chamberlain’s, on the ground of certain
political proclivities which he chose to ascribe to that company.
The text is incoherent, and several theories representing it as a
contamination of two distinct plays have been promulgated. Simpson
supposed that part of a play on Don Antonio has been inserted into one
dealing in five acts with Stukeley’s adventures in England, Ireland,
Spain, Rome, and Africa respectively, and this view is elaborated by
Oliphant, who attempts to disentangle several original and revising
hands, including that of John Fletcher, to whom he assigns 245–335.
Fleay, i. 127, thinks that Dekker made up the play for Paul’s,
<i>c.</i> 1600, out of <i>Stewtley</i> and a <i>Mahomet</i> by Peele.
Apparently he starts from <i>Satiromastix</i>, 980, where Horace says
that Demetrius Fannius ‘cut an innocent Moore i’ the middle, to serue
him in twice; &amp; when he had done, made Poules-worke of it’. But surely
there is a difference between making two plays out of one and making
one play out of two.</p>

<p>The actors’ names point to a performance by the Admiral’s, near 2 Oct.
1602, when they bought the book from Alleyn (cf. ch. xiii). The play
was produced as ‘n. e.’ by the same company on 6 May 1596, but probably
Henslowe’s ‘n. e.’ in this case only indicates a substantial revision,
as the letters are also attached to the notice of a performance of Part
ii on 11 June 1596, and Part ii had already been played as ‘n. e.’
by Strange’s on 28 April 1592. Obviously a Part i must already have

F. S. Boas (1908, <i>Sh. Classics</i>), and J. S. Farmer (<i>S. F.
T.</i>).</p>

<p>The Admiral’s and Chamberlain’s revived ‘the tamynge of A shrowe’ for
Henslowe on 11 June 1594, shortly after the entry in S. R. (Greg,
<i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 164). Presumably it belonged to the Chamberlain’s,
who had acquired it from Pembroke’s, and the 1594 performance may have
been either of the original, or of Shakespeare’s revision, <i>The
Taming of The Shrew</i>, for which 1594 is a plausible date. An early
reference to the printed book is in Harington’s <i>Metamorphosis of
Ajax</i> (1596), 95, ‘For the shrewd wife, read the book of Taming
a Shrew, which hath made a number of us so perfect, that now every
one can rule a shrew in our country, save he that hath her’. It is
to be noted that, unlike <i>Leire</i> (q.v.) and <i>King Lear</i>,
the two versions counted, from the copyright point of view, as one,
so that the transfer of <i>A Shrew</i> to Smethwick made an entry of
<i>The Shrew</i> in S. R. for the purposes of F<sub>1</sub> of Shakespeare
unnecessary. Probably Pembroke’s in their turn got the play from
the earlier Admiral’s or Strange’s. Its date has been placed in or
before 1589, because certain lines of it appear to be parodied both in
Greene’s <i>Menaphon</i> of that year, and in the prefatory epistle to
<i>Menaphon</i> by Nashe. Some such date is confirmed by its direct
imitations from Marlowe’s <i>Tamburlaine</i> (<i>c.</i> 1587) and to
a less extent from <i>Dr. Faustus</i> (<i>c.</i> 1588), which are
collected by Boas, 93. For author, Marlowe, Kyd, Greene, and Peele have
all been suggested, but, so far as we know, Marlowe did not repeat
himself, and the others did not plagiarize him, in this flagrant
manner. Shakespeare also is still often credited with a hand in the
old play,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span> as well as in the revision, and the problem can best be
discussed in connexion with Shakespeare. Sykes gives part to S. Rowley
(q.v.).</p>

Authorship of T. W.</i> (1908, <i>M. L. N.</i> xxiii. 16).</p>

<p>The ascription of the title-page is rejected by Stoll, <i>Webster</i>,
34, and modern writers generally, although Stork, <i>Rowley</i>, 61,
thinks that Rowley may have added comic touches. The use of Webster’s
name may be due to the identity of the plot with that of William
Webster’s <i>Curan and Argentile</i> (1617). But William Webster took
it from Warner’s <i>Albion’s England</i> (1586), iv. xx. From the same
source Greene took it, with a change of names, for <i>Menaphon</i>
(1589), and it is <i>Menaphon</i>, with another change of names, that
the play follows. Brereton ascribes it to Greene himself; Hatcher
thinks that the direct plagiarisms from the source and the archaistic
phrase ‘old Menaphon’ (iv. 2), whereas Greene’s hero is a youth, point
to an early sixteenth-century admirer of Greene. Adams supports the
suggestion of Fleay, i. 287, that this is the <i>War Without Blows and
Love Without Suit</i> written by Heywood for the Admiral’s in 1598, but
this is a mere guess based on Heywood’s title (Greg, <i>Henslowe</i>,
ii. 199). Fleay then supposed that it was revised for Queen Anne’s
about 1607; elsewhere (ii. 332) he supposes it a dramatization of
Webster’s story for Prince Charles’s about 1617.</p>

<p>Greek quotations and other pedantries suggest an academic audience,
but there is little indication of place or date, beyond parallels with
<i>Pedantius</i>, which lead Moore Smith (<i>M. L. R.</i> iii. 143) to
suggest Cambridge and <i>c.</i> 1581–90. Adams thinks that the piece
may have been performed by London schoolboys, and known to Shakespeare.</p>

C. Moore Smith and W. W. Greg (1910, <i>M. S. R.</i>), and J. S. Farmer
(1912, <i>T. F. T.</i>).</p>

<p>The S. R. entry may refer to a ballad based on the play, or may
possibly be a loose description of the play itself. In any case there
is no reason to doubt the existence of a print of about that date.
The evidence of the 1661 title-page is confirmed by the entry of ‘Tom
tyler’ in Archer’s play-list of 1656 (Greg, <i>Masques</i>, cxii).
Chetwood, who cannot be relied on, gave the date as 1598, and an
inaccurate reproduction of this seems to be responsible for the 1578 of
other writers. The text of 1661 has been shown by C. P. G. Scott (in
Schelling’s introduction) to be a rendering into seventeenth-century
orthography of a play whose vocabulary may be put, with decreasing
certainty, within the limits 1530–80, 1540–70, and 1550–60. The
prologue says that the play is ‘set out by prettie boyes’, and the
‘concluding Song’ has a prayer for the preservation of the queen,
‘from perilous chance that hath been seen’. Fleay, ii. 295, somewhat
arbitrarily thinks the Chapel ‘more likely’ to have presented it than
Paul’s. A misinterpretation of Kirkman’s list of 1661 led E. Phillips,
<i>Theatrum Poetarum</i> (1675), to assign the authorship to W. Wager
(<i>M. S. C.</i> i. 325).</p>

<p>Bullen thinks this may be <i>Love Parts Friendship</i>, written by
Chettle and Smith for the Admiral’s in 1602; Fleay, ii. 318, that
it may be the <i>Burbon</i> brought to the Admiral’s by Pembroke’s
in 1597, as the Duke of Bourbon is a chief personage, and also the
<i>Cutting Dick</i> to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span> which Heywood wrote additions for Worcester’s
in 1602 (Greg, <i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 187, 221, 231). There is, of
course, no particular reason why a play by Derby’s should appear
in Henslowe’s diary at all. They were in London in the winters of
1599–1600 and 1600–1. The only link between them and Henslowe is
Heywood, if he was the author of their <i>Edward IV</i> (q.v.). Fleay,
i. 289, thinks that the present play may be by the same hands. Probably
the Earl of Derby himself wrote for the company.</p>

<p>Greg shows that there was only one edition, not two, of 1567. The play
is a non-controversial morality, and may very well date from about 1567.</p>

<p>The text is given by Greg, <i>Henslowe Papers</i>, 142, who infers from
the names of the characters that it may have been the <i>Troilus and
Cressida</i> written by Chettle and Dekker for the Admiral’s in April
1599. The few names of actors are not inconsistent with this (cf. ch.
xiii).</p>

<p>Borrowings from Ben Jonson’s <i>Alchemist</i> (1610) require a
late date, and the assertion of Fleay, i. 26, that this is <i>The
Welshman</i> revived by the Admiral’s on 29 Nov. 1595 may be
disregarded (Greg, <i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 178). There is nothing, beyond
the initials, to connect the play with Robert Armin, and Kreb would
assign it to some young University man.</p>

<p>References to ‘this fair circuit’ and ‘this Round’ are inconclusive
as to whether the play was produced before the Chamberlain’s went to
the Globe in 1599, as their earlier houses were probably also round.
E. Phillips, <i>Theatrum Poetarum</i> (1675), 113, and A. Wood,
<i>Athenae</i> (1691), i. 676, assign the authorship, incredibly, to
Lyly. Fleay, ii. 54, conjectures Lodge; Bullen, <i>O. E. P.</i> iv. 1,
Yarington.</p>

<p>The play, clearly influenced by <i>Tamburlaine</i>, may rest on
one by Farrant (q.v.) <i>c.</i> 1578. There is no record of any
court performance by the Chapel between 1584 and 1601. Fleay, ii.
322, guesses that an allusion in Nashe’s <i>Summer’s Last Will and
Testament</i> (q.v.) points to a performance of this play at Croydon
twelve months earlier. The text is disordered. A prologue ‘To the
audience’ is inserted in Act <span class="allsmcap">II</span> at 621 and refers to a chorus,
but there is none. At 367 is ‘Finis Actus primi’, but ‘Actus Secundus’
is at 502.</p>

<p>The ascription of the play to Dekker and Webster by E. Phillips,
<i>Theatrum Poetarum</i> (1675), 116, was rejected by Langbaine (1691)
and, so far as Webster is concerned, has nothing to recommend it (E.
Stoll, <i>Webster</i>, 34). Ward, iii. 56, finds Dekker’s humour,
and Hunt, <i>Dekker</i>, 42, thinks it Chettle’s, revised by Dekker.
Fleay,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span> ii. 114, gives it to Munday, as the only known writer for
Oxford’s, except Oxford himself. But he is thinking of Oxford’s boy
company of 1580–4, not of the later company of 1601 or earlier, to
whose repertory the play probably belonged, and with whom Munday is not
known to have had anything to do.</p>

<p>The register of Merton College, Oxford, has for 3 Jan. 1567 the entry,
‘Acta est Wylie Beguylie Comoedia Anglica nocte in aedibus Custodis
per scolares, praesentibus Vicecustode, magistris, baccalaureis, cum
omnibus domesticis et nonnullis extraneis; merito laudandi recte agendo
prae se tulerunt summam spem’ (Boas, 157). No connexion is traceable
between this and the extant play, which Greg and Boas regard as of
Cambridge origin. But it does not seem to me markedly academic. The
character Lelia does not particularly suggest the Cambridge Latin
<i>Laelia</i> of 1595, and the epilogue was spoken in a ‘circled
rounde’. The description of himself by Churms (l. 68), as ‘at Cambridge
a scholler, at Cales a souldier, and now in the country a lawyer, and
the next degree shal be a connicatcher’, does not go far in the way of
proof. This same passage fixes the date as not earlier than the Cadiz
expedition of 1596; obviously the use of the phrase ‘tricke of Wily
Beguily’ in Nashe’s <i>Have With You to Saffron Walden</i> of 1596
(<i>Works</i>, iii. 107) proves nothing one way or other as to date,
although Dekker naturally knew the play when he described rogues and
their ‘knavish comedy of Wily-Beguily’ in his <i>Belman of London</i>
of 1608 (<i>Works</i>, iii. 125). If the date is 1596, the authorship
of Peele, suggested by the description of the prologue-speaker as
‘humorous George’, although he is clearly distinct from the ‘fiery
Poet’, and urged by Fleay, ii. 158, and Landsberg, becomes just
possible, chronologically, before his death in November of that year.
But the Shakespearian imitations, although most marked of <i>M. V.</i>
and earlier plays, seem also to extend to <i>Hamlet</i>, <i>M. W.</i>,
and <i>T. N.</i>, and the right date may be <i>c.</i> 1602–6. If the
production was in the ‘circled rounde’ of Paul’s, the quasi-academic
note is explicable. Sykes suggests S. Rowley (q.v.) as part author.
Fleay, <i>Shakespeare Manual</i>, 272, makes an amazing attempt to
interpret the play as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span> satire on Lyly, Lodge, Marston, Chettle,
Dekker, Drayton, Middleton, Chapman, Jonson, Henslowe, the Admiral’s,
the Chamberlain’s, the Chapel, and Paul’s. In the Induction, a juggler
finds the title <i>Spectrum</i> exhibited, and later, ‘<i>Spectrum</i>
is conueied away: and <i>Wily beguiled</i>, stands in the place of it’

<p>Fleay, ii. 155, assigned the play to Peele, chiefly on the ground that
a snatch of song is from his <i>Hunting of Cupid</i> (q.v.). But Peele
died in 1596, and Koeppel points out that the phrase (Bullen, p. 129),
‘Then reason’s fled to animals, I see’, presupposes the existence of

<p>This ten-scene play from a four-play bill has merit, but most
modern critics are unable to regard that merit as of Shakespearian
type, although Ward, ii. 231, finds Shakespeare’s hand in some
passages, and Fleay, after wantonly guessing at Edmund Shakespeare
(<i>Shakespeare</i>, 303), remained impressed (ii. 206) by the
external evidence, and thought that the play must be Shakespeare’s
original ending to an earlier version of <i>The Miseries of Enforced
Marriage</i>, subsequently altered by his collaborator, George Wilkins
(q.v.), to end happily. This is ingenious, but too conjectural. The
play, like that of Wilkins, takes its material from the history of
Walter Calverley, executed for murder on 5 Aug. 1605, which is told in
Stowe’s <i>Annales</i> and was the subject of contemporary pamphlets.
Dobell and Sykes argue a case on internal evidence for the authorship
of Wilkins himself.</p>


<h3>B. MASKS</h3>


<h4><i>Gesta Grayorum. 1594</i></h4>

was presented (by His Highness’s Command) for the Entertainment of Q.
Elizabeth; who, with the Nobles of both Courts, was present thereat.
<i>For W. Canning.</i> [Epistle to Matthew Smyth, of the Inner Temple,
signed ‘W. C.’ The publication is recorded in Trinity Term 1688 (Arber,
<i>London Term Catalogues</i>, ii. 230).]</p>

<p><i>Editions</i> in Nichols, <i>Elizabeth</i><sup>1, 2</sup>, iii. 262
(1807–23), and by W. W. Greg (1914, <i>M. S. R.</i>) and B. Brown
(1921).</p>

<p>This is a narrative of the reign of a Christmas Prince, or Lord of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
Misrule (cf. <i>Mediaeval Stage</i>, i. 417), appointed at Gray’s Inn
for the Christmas of 1594. The Prince was a Norfolk man, Henry Helmes,
and a list of the members of the Inn who held positions at his court
is given in the tract. The revels began on St. Thomas’s Eve, 20 Dec.,
continued until Twelfth Night, were resumed at Candlemas, and again at
Shrovetide, when the Prince’s reign terminated.</p>

<p>On Innocents’ Day, 28 Dec., at night, the Inner Temple were
entertained, and a stage set up, but the crowd was too great for the
‘inventions’ contemplated, and ‘it was thought good not to offer any
thing of account, saving dancing and revelling with gentlewomen;
and after such sports, a Comedy of Errors (like to <i>Plautus</i>
his <i>Menechmus</i>) was played by the players. So that night was
begun, and continued to the end, in nothing but confusion and errors;
whereupon, it was ever afterwards called, <i>The Night of Errors</i>’.
On 30 Dec. an indictment was preferred against a supposed sorcerer,
containing a charge ‘that he had foisted a company of base and common
fellows, to make up our disorders with a play of errors and confusions;
and that that night had gained to us discredit, and itself a nickname
of Errors’. Presumably the players of Shakespeare’s <i>Comedy of
Errors</i> were the Chamberlain’s men, and the Treasurer of the
Chamber’s record (App. B) of a play at court by these men, as well as
the Admiral’s, on 28 Dec. is a slip for 27 Dec. (<i>M. L. R.</i> ii.
10).</p>

<p>On 3 Jan. many nobles were entertained with a show illustrating the
amity of Graius and Templarius. It was followed by speeches from
six ‘Councellors’, advising respectively ‘the Exercise of War’,
‘the Study of Philosophy’, ‘Eternizement and Fame, by Buildings and
Foundations’, ‘Absoluteness of State and Treasure’, ‘Vertue, and a
Gracious Government’, and ‘Pass-times and Sports’. These are ascribed
by Spedding, i. 342, to Francis Bacon (q.v.), a view which finds some
confirmation in the fact that the Alnwick MS., many of the contents of
which are by Bacon, once contained a copy of some ‘Orations at Graies
Inne Revells’ (Burgoyne, xii). It is amusing to note that on 5 Dec.
1594 Lady Bacon, his mother, wrote to his brother Anthony, ‘I trust
they will not mum nor mask nor sinfully revel at Gray’s Inn’ (Spedding,
i. 326). The speeches of three of the ‘Councellors’, with one by the
Prince, are also preserved, without ascription, in <i>Inner Temple
Petyt MS.</i> 583, 43, f. 294.</p>

<p>On 6 Jan. appeared six Knights of the Helmet ‘in a very stately mask,
and danced a new devised measure; and after that they took to them
ladies and gentlewomen, and danced with them their galliards, and so
departed with musick’.</p>

<p>On 1 Feb. the Prince visited Greenwich, and promised to return at
Shrovetide. On his way back, he was met with a Latin oration by a boy
at St. Paul’s School.</p>

<p>At Shrovetide, the Prince took his mask to the court at Whitehall.
The maskers were the Prince of Purpoole and his Seven Knights;
the torchbearers eight Pigmies; the presenters Proteus, Thamesis,
Amphitrite, and one of the Prince’s Esquires; the musicians two
Tritons, two Nymphs, and a Tartarian Page.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span></p>

<p>The performance was upon a stage. After a hymn, the presenters made
speeches setting out how the Prince and Knights were in an Adamantine
Rock, to be released by Proteus, on the discovery of a Power (the
Queen) of more attractive virtue. The maskers issued from the Rock,
and danced ‘a new devised measure, &amp;c.’; then took ladies, and danced
‘their galliards, courants, &amp;c.’; then danced ‘another new measure’.
The Pigmies brought in eight escutcheons, with the maskers’ impresses,
which the Esquire presented to the Queen. The maskers then entered the
rock, while another hymn was sung.</p>

<p>The maskers were Henry Helmes (Prince), William Cooke, Jarvis Tevery,
John Lambert, Molineux, Grimes, Paylor, and Campnies.</p>

<p>After the mask, the courtiers danced a measure, and Elizabeth said,
‘What! shall we have bread and cheese after a banquet?’</p>

<p>The maskers were presented to the Queen ‘on the next day’ and praised
by her. The narrative goes on to record that ‘the same night’ was
fighting at barriers, in which the Prince took part as a defendant with
the Earl of Cumberland against the Earl of Essex and other challengers,
and won the prize; and concludes, ‘Thus on <i>Shrove-Tuesday</i>, at
the Court, were our sports and revels ended’. The dating is not quite
clear, but it seems probable that the mask and barriers were both on
the Tuesday, and the presentation on Ash Wednesday, presumably as the
Queen went to chapel. Conceivably, however, the mask was on Monday,
and the presentation and barriers on Tuesday. The Gray’s Inn records
(Fletcher, 107) note a disbursement on 11 Feb. 1595 to William Johnson
and Edward Morrys, who served as the Prince’s Lord Chancellor and Lord
Treasurer, of 100 marks for ‘the gentlemen for their sports &amp; shewes
this Shrovetyde at the court before the Queens Majestie’. There was
also a levy on 8 May for the ‘shewes &amp; desports’ of sums varying from
4<i>s.</i> to 10<i>s.</i> according to status, while the public stock
of the house was to contribute £30.</p>

<p>The speeches in the mask were apparently by Francis Davison, one of
the Prince’s Gentlemen Pensioners, who included in his <i>Poetical
Rapsody</i> (1602), sign. D 3 v<sup>o</sup>, amongst Sonnets, &amp;c., ‘To his first
Loue’, one ‘Vpon presenting her with the speech of Grayes-Inne Maske
at the Court 1594, consisting of three partes, The Story of Proteus
Transformations, the wonders of the Adamantine Rocke, and a speech to
her Maiestie’. The <i>Poetical Rapsody</i>, sign. K 8, also contains
the opening hymn of the mask, which begins ‘Of Neptune’s Empyre let us
sing’, and ascribes it to Thomas Campion (q.v.). Whether ‘The Song at

<h4><i>The Twelve Months. 1608–12</i></h4>

<p>[<i>MS.</i>] Formerly <i>penes</i> Collier, but not now among his
papers in <i>Egerton MS.</i> 2623.</p>

<p><i>Editions</i> by J. P. Collier, <i>Five Court Masques</i> (1848),
131, with title ‘The Masque of the Twelve Months’.</p>

<p>The maskers are the twelve Months; the antimaskers Pages; the
presenters Madge Howlet, Pigwiggen a Fairy, Beauty, Aglaia, the Pulses,
Prognostication, and Somnus; the musicians the twelve Spheres.</p>

<p>The locality is not given, but the presence of a king is contemplated.
The text is disordered, but can easily be reconstructed, as follows:
Madge Howlet, ‘going up towards the King’, and Pigwiggen speak
the opening dialogue (Collier, 137). The Spheres sing the first
song calling Beauty from her fort, the Heart (140). This is the
scene; on it are plumes, ‘the ensignes of the darling of the yeare,
delicious Aprill’. Beauty, Aglaia, and the Pulses, ‘beating before
them up towardes the King’, speak a dialogue (131). The Pages dance
an ‘antemasque’ (133). Beauty and Aglaia speak a dialogue (134).
The maskers appear, and are presented by Beauty (134). The second
‘antemasque’ is danced (134). Beauty and Aglaia speak a dialogue (134).
Prognostication enters, and prognosticates (135). The maskers descend,
and Beauty describes April, a prince ‘lov’d of all, yett will not
love’, with a ‘triple plume’ (135). After a second song, ‘they dance
their entrie’ (141). Beauty and Aglaia speak a dialogue (136). There is
a third song (141). ‘They dance their mayne dance: which done, Bewty
invites them to dance with the Ladies’ (137). There is a fourth song
(142). ‘They dance with the Ladies, and the whole Revells follows’
(137). Beauty calls on Somnus (140). There is a last song (142). ‘They
dance their going off’ (140).</p>

<p>Brotanek, 346, suggests 1 Jan. 1612 as a probable date. I agree with
him that ‘charming all warre from his mild monarchie’ (136) suggests
James I, although I do not think that ‘our fairy King’ (137) is
necessarily a reminiscence of the <i>Mask of Oberon</i>, especially as
this fairy king is James and not Henry. In any case ‘the heart of the
yeare’ (132), ‘prime of this newe yeare’ (135), ‘this winter nighte’
(141) do not require a performance on 1 Jan. In fact, April and not
January leads the months in the mask. I would add to Brotanek’s notes
that April is clearly danced by a Prince of Wales, and that ‘lov’d of
all, yett will not love’ fits in with the uncertainty as to Henry’s
matrimonial intentions which prevailed in 1612. But he is not very
likely to have given two masks in the winter of 1611–12, nor is there
any evidence of any mask that winter except the <i>Love Restored</i> of
6 Jan. Of course <i>The Twelve Months</i> may never have been actually
performed. I have thought that it might have been the mask abandoned by
Anne on account of the death of the Queen of Spain in Dec. 1611 (cf.
Jonson, <i>Love Restored</i>). Beauty, ‘our fairy Queene’, is said to
be ‘Great president of all those princely revells’ in honour of the
‘fairy King’. But the mask is danced by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span> men, not women, which seems to
put a Queen’s mask out of the question. No mask has yet been traced in
the winter of 1609–10. I am afraid I must leave the date open. If Henry
led the dance, his death in Nov. 1612 gives one limit. The ‘antemasque’
is more likely to have been introduced after than before 1608. The use
of Pigwiggen as a fairy name recurs in Drayton’s <i>Nymphidia</i>,
published in 1627.</p>


<h4><i>Mask of Flowers. 6 Jan. 1614</i></h4>

<p><i>S. R.</i> 1614, Jan. 21 (Nidd). ‘The maske of flowers by the gent.
of Graies Inne vppon Twelfe Night 1613.’ <i>Robert Wilson</i> (Arber,
iii. 540).</p>

<p>1614. The Maske of Flowers. Presented By the Gentlemen of Graies-Inne,
at the Court of Whitehall, in the Banquetting House, vpon Twelfe
night, 1613. Being the last of the Solemnities and Magnificences which
were performed at the marriage of the right honourable the Earle of
Somerset, and the Lady Francis daughter of the Earle of Suffolke, Lord
Chamberlaine. <i>N. O. for Robert Wilson.</i> [With Epistle to Sir
Francis Bacon by I. G., W. D., T. B. These initials, presumably of
Gray’s Inn men, have not been identified.]</p>

<p><i>Editions</i> in Nichols, <i>James</i> (1828), ii. 735, and H. A.
Evans, <i>English Masques</i> (1897).</p>

<p>The maskers, in white embroidered with carnation and silver and
vizards, were thirteen transformed Flowers; the antimaskers in ‘the
anticke-maske of daunce’ Pantaloon, Courtesan, Swiss and his Wife,
Usurer, Midwife, Smug and his Wench, Fretelyne, Bawd, Roaring Boy,
Citizen, Mountebank, Jewess of Portugal, Chimney-Sweeper and his Wench;
the musicians twelve Garden Gods, also described as Priests, and in the
‘anticke-maske of the song’ Miller, Wine Cooper, Vintner’s Boy, Brewer,
Skipper, Fencer, Pedlar, Barber; the presenters Invierno, Primavera,
Gallus the Sun’s Post, Silenus, Kawasha, and attendants.</p>

<p>The locality was the Banqueting House, at the lower end of which was a
‘travers painted in perspective’, as a city wall and gate, with temples
of Silenus and Kawasha on either side. The antimasks represented a
challenge, directed by the Sun, between wine and tobacco. ‘The travers
being drawne’ disclosed an elaborate garden sloping up to a mount and
arbour (33 ft. long × 21 ft. high) with a bank of flowers before it.
Upon a charm the flowers vanished to give place to the maskers, who
danced their first and second measure, then took ladies, for ‘measures,
corantoes, durettoes, morascoes, galliards’, and then ‘daunced their
parting measure’, which was followed by compliments to the king and the
bride and groom.</p>

<p>For general notices of the Somerset wedding masks, cf. s.v. Campion,
<i>Mask of Squires</i>. On 23 Dec. Chamberlain wrote to Carleton
(Birch, i. 282), ‘Sir Francis Bacon prepares a masque to honour this
marriage, which will stand him in above £2000; and though he have
been offered some help by the House, and specially by Mr. Solicitor,
Sir Henry Yelverton, who would have sent him £500, yet he would not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
accept it, but offers them the whole charge with the honour. Marry,
his obligations are such, as well to his majesty as to the great lord
and to the whole house of Howards, as he can admit no partner’. On 5
Jan. (Birch, i. 288) he briefly notes, ‘Mr. Attorney’s masque is for
to-morrow, and for a conclusion of Christmas and these shows together’.</p>

<p>The records of Gray’s Inn confirm Chamberlain’s account, by giving no
signs that any expense fell on the Inn. On a letter by Bacon which may
refer to this occasion, cf. s.v. Bacon.</p>

<p>Osborne, <i>James</i>, 82, a not very accurate writer, speaks of a
Gray’s Inn mask at court, following an Anglo-Scottish quarrel between
Mr. Hawley of Gray’s Inn and Mr. Maxwell. Probably he has this mask,
which was to honour a Scot, in mind. The quarrel was in fact over in
June 1612 (Birch, i. 173). I doubt whether either this mask or the
joint Gray’s Inn and Inner Temple mask of 1612–13 had anything to do
with it.</p>

<h4><i>Bristol Entertainment. August 1574</i></h4>

<p>1575. The whole Order howe our Soveraigne Ladye Queene Elizabeth was
receyved into the Citie of Bristowe, in August, and the Speeches spoken
before her presens at her Entry; with the residue of Versis and Matter
that might not be spoken (for distance of the place), but sent in a
Book over the Waetter. <i>Thomas Marshe.</i> [In ‘<i>The Firste Parte

<p><i>Editions</i> in Nichols, <i>Eliz.</i> i. 393 (1788, 1823), and by J.
P. Collier (1867).</p>

<p>Probably Churchyard was the deviser of the entertainment, as he calls
the <i>Chippes</i> ‘a book of all my English verses in meter’. He
says, ‘Some of these Speeches could not be spoken, by means of a
Scholemaister, who envied that any stranger should set forth these
Shows’. <i>A worthie Dittie, song before the Queens Majestie at
Bristow</i>, by D. S[and], not in the Entertainment, is in <i>The
Paradise of Daynty Devises</i> (1576). Elizabeth was at Bristol 13–21
Aug. 1574 and lay at John Young’s. Fame, a boy with a speech in English
verse, met her at the High Cross. At the next gate were Salutation,
Gratulation, and Obedient Good Will, with their verses. On 14 Aug.
the Queen attended divine service at the College. On 15 and 16 Aug.
the Forts of Peace and Feeble Policy were arrayed, and there were
sham fights by land and sea, with speeches by Dissuasion, Persuasion,
and John Roberts, who apparently wrote his own. Was he the envious
schoolmaster?</p>

<p>Elizabeth was at Norwich 16–22 Aug. 1578. The diary is as follows:</p>

much commended’ in the park of the Earl of Surrey at Kenninghall on
12 Aug.; also divers ‘triumphes and devises’ in Suffolk, of which he
only specifies ‘a shew representing the Phayries (as well as might
be) ... in the whiche shew a rich jewell was presented to the Queenes
Highnesse’ at Sir Thomas Kidson’s house, Hengrave Hall, during 28–30
Aug. In <i>Churchyards Challenge</i> (1593) he claims ‘The whole
deuises pastimes and plaies at Norwich, before her Maistie’, and also
‘The Commedy before her Maestie at Norwich in the fielde when she went
to dinner to my Lady Gerninghams’ at Costessy (19 Aug.).</p>

<p><i>Edition</i> in Nichols, <i>Eliz.</i><sup>2</sup> (1823), ii. 310.</p>

<p>This was a tilt, before François of Bourbon, dauphin of Auvergne, Artus
de Cossé, marshal of France, and other commissioners from France, for
the treaty of marriage between Elizabeth and the Duke of Anjou. The
challenge was delivered by a boy in red and white, as the Queen came
from Chapel on 16 April 1581. The tilt, first fixed for 24 April, was
put off to 1 May, 8 May, and finally 15 May. The gallery at the end
of the tilt-yard was named the Castle or Fortress of Perfect Beauty,
and the challengers, the Earl of Arundel, Lord Windsor, Philip Sidney,
and Fulke Greville, called themselves the Four Foster Children of
Desire. They entered from the stable, with trains of followers and a
Rowling Trench of printed canvas, to besiege the fortress. From this
boys spoke and sang, and cannonades of perfumes were shot off, while
flowers and other fancies were flung from scaling ladders. Then came
twenty-one defendants, each with his ‘invention’ and speech. They were
Henry Grey, Sir Thomas Perot, Anthony Cooke, Thomas Ratcliffe, Henry
Knolles, William Knolles, Robert Knolles, Francis Knolles, Rafe Bowes,
Thomas Kelwaie, George Goring, William Tresham, Robert Alexander,
Edward Dennie, Hercules Meautus, Edward Moore, Richard Skipwith,
Richard Ward, Edward Digbie, Henry Nowell, Henry Brunkerd. Perot and
Cooke were ‘both in like armour, beset with apples and fruit, the one
signifying Adam and the other Eve, who had haire hung all down his
helmet’. Their page was an Angel. Ratcliffe was a Desolate Knight, with
a page who presented his shield. The four Knolles brothers were Sons of
Despair, with Mercury for a page. The speeches of the pages are given.
Each defendant ran six courses with the challengers. ‘In the middest
of the running came in Sir Henrie Leigh, as unknowne, and when he had
broken his six staves, went out in like manner againe.’ At the end of
the first day the boy who gave the challenge announced a second on the
morrow.</p>

<p>On the second day the challengers entered in a chariot ‘forewearied
and half overcome’ with a lady representing Desire, and a consort of
music. A herald made a speech for them. The defendants entered, and the
tournay and barriers followed. At the end a boy clad in ash colour and
bearing an olive-branch made submission of the challengers to the Queen.</p>

<p>Foulkes, lxiii. 49, says that a set of blank cheques for this tilt are
in <i>Ashm. MS.</i> 845, f. 166.</p>

<p>See ch. xxiii, s.v. Peele, <i>Anglorum Feriae</i>.</p>


<h4><i>Harefield Entertainment. 1602</i></h4>

<p>Elizabeth was at Harefield Place, Middlesex, the house of Sir Thomas
Egerton, Lord Keeper, and his wife Alice, Countess Dowager of Derby,
from 31 July to 2 Aug. 1602. At the same house Milton’s <i>Arcades</i>
was performed before Lady Derby in 1634. Seven fragments of the
entertainment have been preserved, and are printed by Nichols,
<i>Eliz.</i> iii. 570, 586, and Bond, <i>Lyly</i>, i. 491. Accounts of
expenditure involved, and a list of the gifts in kind contributed by
Egerton’s friends on this occasion are in <i>Egerton Papers</i>, 340,
but the account in 342–4 is a forgery (<i>vide infra</i>).</p>

<p>(i) Dialogue between a Bailiff and Dairymaid, and presentation of a
rake and fork to the Queen, as she entered the demesne near the dairy
house.</p>

<p>(ii) Dialogue at the steps of the house, and presentation of a heart,
by Place ‘in a partie-colored roobe, like the brick house’ and Time
‘with yeollow haire, and in a green roabe, with an hower glasse,
stopped, not runninge’.</p>

<p>(iii) Verse petition accompanying gift of a robe of rainbows on behalf
of St. Swithin by Lady Walsingham on Monday morning [2 Aug.].</p>

<p>(iv) Farewell of Place, ‘attyred in black mourning aparell’ on the
Queen’s departure, with presentation of an anchor.</p>

<p>(v) Verse ‘Complaint of the Satyres against the Nymphes’.</p>

<p>(vi) Song and speech by a Mariner, who entered the ‘presence’ with a
lottery box, ‘supposed to come from the Carricke’.</p>

<p>(vii) ‘The Severall Lottes’, a list of gifts and blanks, with a
poesy accompanying each, and the names of the ladies who drew them.
These were the Queen, the Dowager Countess of Derby, the Countesses
of Derby, Worcester, and Warwick, Lady Scroope, Mistresses Nevill,
Thynne, Hastinges, and Bridges, Ladies Scudamore, Francis, Knevette,
and Susan Vere, Mrs. Vavissour, Ladies Southwell and Anne Clifford,
Mrs. Hyde, Ladies Kildare, Howard of Effingham and Paget, Mistresses
Kiddermister and Strangwidge, the Mother of the Maids, Ladies
Cumberland, Walsingham, and Newton, Mrs. Wharton, Ladies Digbye and
Dorothy [Hastinges] and Mrs. Anselowe. One name, ending in ‘liffe’
is illegible. It may be Ratcliffe. One MS. adds three lots assigned
to ‘country wenches’. Most of these ladies were maids<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span> of honour and
others who came with the court; one or two, e.g. Mrs. Kiddermister,
were country neighbours of the Egerton’s.</p>

<p>These pieces are derived from various sources:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) A transcript made by R. Churton in 1803 of a contemporary
MS. found at Arbury, the house of Sir Roger Newdigate, to whose family
Harefield passed in 1675, contains (i)-(v) and was printed by Nichols.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A <i>Conway MS.</i>, printed by P. Cunningham in <i>Sh. Soc.
Papers</i>, ii. 65, contains (iii), the song from (vi), and (vii), with
the heading ‘The Devise to entertayne hir M<sup>ty</sup> at Harfielde ...’ and
the date 1602.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The second edition (1608) of Francis Davison’s <i>Poetical
Rhapsody</i> contains the speech from (vi) and (vii), with the
incorrect indication ‘at the Lord Chancellor’s house, 1601’, which
misled Nichols into supposing it to belong to some entertainment at
York Place, the year before that of Harefield. The item comes between
two pieces by Sir John Davies and has the initials J. D.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The diary of John Manningham (<i>Harl. MS.</i> 5353, f. 95)
contains amongst entries of Feb. 1603 some extracts from (i) and (vii),
dating the latter in ‘the last Sumer at hir M<sup>ties</sup> being with the L.
Keeper’.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) A contemporary MS., printed as <i>Poetical Miscellanies</i>
(<i>Percy Soc.</i> lv), 5, has (vii) dated 1602.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) <i>Talbot MS.</i> K, f. 43, in the College of Arms, contains
(iv) as given at ‘Harville’ with the date ‘Aug. 1602’ and is printed by
Lodge, ii. 560.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) <i>B.M. Birch MS.</i> 4173 contains a similar copy of (iv).</p>

<p>On the strength of the <i>Poetical Rhapsody</i>, (vii) is generally
assigned to Sir John Davies, which hardly justified Dr. Grosart in
assigning all the pieces to him (<i>Works</i>, ii, clxxii). Bond
transferred the whole to Lyly, primarily as a conjecture, but was
confirmed in his view by finding in <i>Egerton Papers</i>, 343, a
payment to ‘M<sup>r</sup> Lillyes man, which brought the lotterye boxe to
Harefield’. But the document in which this is found, and which also
contains the item ‘x<sup>li</sup> to Burbidges players for Othello’, is one of
Collier’s forgeries (Ingleby, 261).</p>

<p>John Chamberlain (<i>Letters</i>, 164, 169) sent Dudley Carleton ‘the
Quenes entertainment at the Lord Kepers’ on 19 Nov. 1602, and on 23
Dec. wrote that, as Carleton liked the Lord Keeper’s devices so ill, he
had not cared to get Sir Robert Cecil’s (cf. ch. xxiii, s.v. Cecil).</p>

<p>The speeches for three of the pageants were Jonson’s, and some of those
for a fourth Middleton’s. Two others were in Latin. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span> Dekker himself
probably contributed the rest. Prefixed is a dialogue intended, but not

<h4><i>The Christmas Prince. 1607–8</i></h4>

<p>This is the narrative of a lordship of misrule at St. John’s during
the Christmas of 1607–8. The MS. includes the text of a number of
plays and shows. Unfortunately Bliss omits the text of these, with

<i>Time’s Complaint</i>, <i>Somnium Fundatoris</i>, <i>Philomathes</i>,

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span></p>

<p>G. Ormerod, <i>Hist. of Cheshire</i> (1882), i. 381, gives a
description of the show from a shorter account or programme in <i>Harl.
MS.</i> 2150, f. 186, indexed (f. 3<sup>v</sup>) as ‘M<sup>r</sup>. Amory’s new shew
invented by him’. This is confirmed by the lines:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">

Nathaniel Fosbrooke.</i> [Epistle to Sir Thomas Campbell, Lord Mayor.]</p>

<p><i>Edition</i> by J. Nichols, <i>James</i>, ii. 315 (1828).</p>

<p>It appears from the city records that the device was by Munday, and
that Richard Burbadge and John Rice of the King’s men delivered the
speeches as Amphion and Corinea; cf. <i>Repertory</i>, xxix, f. 232<sup>v</sup>,
and Letter Book D.D., f. 148<sup>v</sup>, quoted by Halliwell-Phillipps in
<i>Athenaeum</i> (19 May 1888), Stopes, <i>Burbage</i>, 108, and C. W.

<h2 class="smaller">APPENDIX A<br />
<span class="subhed">A COURT CALENDAR</span></h2></div>


<p>[<i>Bibliographical Note.</i>&mdash;This is primarily a list of plays,
masks, and quasi-dramatic entertainments at court. The chronological
evidence for the plays mainly rests upon Appendix B. Tilts and a few
miscellaneous entertainments are included. And it has seemed worth
while to trace the movements of the court, partly in order to locate
the palaces at which the winter performances were given, partly
because of the widespread use of mimetic pageantry during Elizabeth’s
progresses and visits abroad. For the main migrations of the household
(in small capitals), the authorities here cited are confirmed by the
daily or weekly indications of a much more detailed <i>Itinerarium</i>
than can be printed. Additions from sources not explored by me may
be possible to the record of shorter visits or even that of the
by-progresses, upon which Elizabeth was not always accompanied by the
full household. I have not attempted to deal so completely with the
Jacobean period. The King’s constant absences from court on hunting
journeys are difficult to track and of no interest to dramatic history.
Appendix B will show at which of the court plays he was personally
present. The principal material used may be classified as follows:
(<i>a</i>) The royal movements are frequently noted in ambassadorial
dispatches, in private letters, notably those of Roger Manners to
the Earls of Rutland (<i>Rutland MSS.</i>), of Rowland Whyte, court
postmaster, to Sir Robert Sidney (<i>Sydney Papers</i>), and of John
Chamberlain to Sir Dudley Carleton (<i>Letters</i>, ed. Camden Soc.,
and Birch, <i>Court of James</i>) and Sir Ralph Winwood (<i>Winwood
Memorials</i>); and in the diaries of Henry Machyn, Lord Burghley
(Haynes-Murdin, ii. 745; <i>Hatfield MSS.</i>, i. 149; v. 69; xiii.
141, 199, 389, 464, 506, 596), Sir Francis Walsingham (<i>Camden
Miscellany</i>, vi), and John Dee. (<i>b</i>) Collections of State and
quasi-State Papers contain many dated and located documents emanating
from the court, such as proclamations, privy seals, signet letters,
and less formal communications from the sovereign or a secretary
or other officer in attendance. Unfortunately Elizabeth’s letters
missive have never been collected, and many of them are unlocated.
Naturally ministerial documents require handling with discretion, lest
the writers should be away from court. Letters patent bear the date
and location of the Chancellor’s <i>recepi</i>, and the Chancellor
was largely detached from the court. The sources for (<i>a</i>) and
(<i>b</i>) are given in the <i>Bibl. Note</i> to ch. i. (<i>c</i>)
The <i>Register</i> of the Privy Council records the localities of
the meetings of that body, but it must be borne in mind that the
registration was not very perfect (cf. ch. ii), and also that, although
the Council ordinarily followed the court, meetings were occasionally
held in Westminster or London, either at the Star Chamber or in the
house of a councillor or even a citizen, when the court happened to be
out of town. (<i>d</i>) Church bells were rung when the sovereign moved
into or out of a parish, and the churchwardens entered the ringers’
fees in their accounts. The entries in J. V. Kitto, <i>The Accounts
of the Churchwardens of St. Martin’s in the Fields, 1525–1603</i>
(1901, cited as <i>Martin’s</i>), record many comings and goings
from Whitehall, but in some cases the date entered appears to be
other than that of the actual ringing, either by error or because
the payment was on a different day. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span> extracts from the accounts
of St. Margaret’s, Westminster (cited as <i>Margaret’s</i>), in J.
Nichols, <i>Illustrations</i>, 1, of Lambeth in D. Lysons, <i>Environs
of London</i>, i. 222, and S. Denne, <i>Historical Particulars of
Lambeth</i> (1795, <i>Bibl. Top. Brit.</i> x. 185), of Fulham in
T. Faulkner, <i>Fulham</i> (1813), 139, of Kingston in Lysons,
<i>Environs</i>, i. 164, and of Wandsworth by C. T. Davis in <i>Surrey
Arch. Colls.</i>, xviii (1903), 96, are scrappy and the year concerned
is not always clear. Nichols, <i>Eliz.</i> iii. 37, gives an analogous
record from the accounts of Chalk in Kent of the occasions on which the
local carts were requisitioned for removes from Greenwich. (<i>e</i>)
The dates and localities of knightings are given in W. A. Shaw, <i>The
Knights of England</i> (1906), but many of them are from inconsistent
and untrustworthy sources. (<i>f</i>) The <i>Chamber Accounts</i>
(cf. App. B) contain under the annual heading ‘Apparelling of Houses’
summaries of monthly bills sent in by the Gentlemen Ushers of the
Chamber of their expenses while engaged in making preparations for
royal visits. They yield much new information as to the houses visited,
but only very approximately date the visits. And it may be that the
Ushers occasionally had to prepare for a visit which never took place.
Analogous information is contained in the <i>Declared Accounts</i> of
the Office of Works. A single account of the Cofferer of the Household,
printed by Nichols, i. 92, gives a daily record of the locality of the
household throughout the progress of 1561; as far as I know, it is
the only extant document of its kind. (<i>g</i>) J. Nichols, in his
<i>Progresses of Elizabeth</i><sup>2</sup> (1823) and <i>Progresses of James
I</i> (1828), drew fully upon the contemporary printed descriptions of
state entries and progresses, of which a list is given in ch. xxiv,
and upon such ‘gests’ of progresses (cf. ch. iv) as survive. I have
been able to correct and amplify his record of houses visited to a
great extent, as much of the material now available, notably the Privy
Council Register and the Chamber Accounts, was not used by him, and
he occasionally assumed that royal plans were carried out, when they
were not. I have done what I can to identify the royal hosts and their
houses, but there is more of conjecture in my lists than my query-marks
quite indicate. The Chamber Accounts entries are not in chronological
order. Often only a name or a locality is given, and a good deal of
plotting of routes on a map has been necessary. A more thorough study
of local and family histories than I have been able to undertake would
doubtless add corrections and further details. Local antiquaries might
well follow the lines of study opened up by E. Green, <i>Did Queen
Elizabeth visit Bath in 1574 and 1592</i> (1879, <i>Proc. of Bath
Field Club</i>, iv. 105), W. D. Cooper, <i>Queen Elizabeth’s Visits
to Sussex</i> (1852, <i>Sussex Arch. Colls.</i>, v. 190), W. Kelly,
<i>Royal Progresses and Visits to Leicester</i> (1884), and M. Christy,
<i>The Progresses of Queen Elizabeth through Essex and the Houses in
which she stayed</i> (1917, <i>Essex Review</i>, xxvi. 115, 181). A
knowledge of sixteenth-and seventeenth-century roads is useful. The
Elizabethan list in W. Smith, <i>The Particular Description of England,
1588</i> (ed. H. B. Wheatley and E. W. Ashbee, 1879) is fuller than
that in W. Harrison, <i>Description of England</i> (ed. <i>N. S. S.</i>
ii. 107), or that described from a manuscript of <i>c.</i> 1603 by G.
S. Thomson in <i>E. H. R.</i> xxxiii. 234. The seventeenth-century
description of J. Ogilby, <i>Itinerarium Angliae</i> (1675) became
the parent of many travellers’ guides. But it does not include three
private royal roads largely used in removes; viz. the King’s road by
Chelsea to Richmond and Hampton Court, Theobald’s Road, and a road from
Lambeth Ferry to Greenwich and Eltham. Useful studies are T. F. Ordish,
<i>History of Metropolitan Roads</i> (<i>L. T. R.</i> viii. 1), and H.
G. Fordham, <i>Studies in Carto-Bibliography</i> (1914). Other books
are given in D. Ballen, <i>Bibliography of Roadmaking and Roads</i>
(1914).]</p>

<h2 class="smaller">APPENDIX B<br />
<span class="subhed">COURT PAYMENTS</span></h2></div>

<p>The body of this appendix contains extracts from the accounts of the
Treasurer of the Chamber and the Office of Revels, in which expenditure
on plays or masks at court is recorded. But in view of the importance
of these documents as sources for the history of court entertainment,
it will be well to add something about their general nature and state
of preservation to what has already been said about the procedure of
the Treasurer of the Chamber in ch. ii and that of the Revels Office in
ch. iii.</p>


<h3>THE AUDIT OF HOUSEHOLD ACCOUNTS</h3>

<p>Most, but not all, of the accounts preserved are records of audit.
There is, unfortunately, no systematic history of the Audit Office; but
the somewhat scrappy notices in F. S. Thomas, <i>The Ancient Exchequer
of England</i> (1848), and H. Hall, <i>Studies in English Official
Historical Documents</i> (1908), and <i>A Formula Book of English
Official Historical Documents</i>, Part II (1909), may be supplemented
for the Tudor period by the valuable study of M. D. George, <i>The
Origin of the Declared Account</i> (1916, E. H. R. xxxi. 41). The
Record Office series of <i>Lists and Indexes</i> includes lists of
<i>Declared Accounts</i> (ii) and <i>Exchequer Accounts</i> (xxxv).
Normally the auditing of royal expenditure was a function of the
mediaeval Exchequer. The procedure was for the officer charged with
incurring expenditure to appear as accountant before the Auditor-Baron
and his Clerk, and produce detailed statements, known as ‘particulars’,
together with vouchers for sums already spent out of any ‘imprest’ or
advance that had been made to him, and the warrants under which his
expenditure was authorized. From these the Exchequer officers prepared
a ‘compotus’ or balance sheet, signed it, when the balance was settled,
as a record that the accountant was ‘quietus’ or quit from debt to
the Crown, and passed it through the King’s Remembrancer to the Lord
Treasurer’s Remembrancer, in whose office it was enrolled by the Clerk
of the Pipe on the roll of ‘foreign’ or non-revenue accounts. It
was then returned to the King’s Remembrancer, who kept it, with the
particulars and vouchers as subsidiary documents. It was a lengthy
and cumbrous process. Moreover, the Lord Treasurer, like the Lord
Chancellor, was one of the high officers of state whose functions came
at an early date under the control of the barons, and the same motives,
which led the sovereign (cf. ch. ii) to develop in the Wardrobe and
Chamber an executive machinery independent of the Lord Chancellor, also
led him to desire that his more private expenditure should be withdrawn
from the survey of the Exchequer. Thus we find the Treasurer of the
Chamber accountable (cf. ch. ii) at the end of the fifteenth century
to the King alone, and in the mid-sixteenth century to the Court of
Surveyors or to <i>ad hoc</i> auditors specially appointed by the King
or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span> the Privy Council. When the Court of Augmentations absorbed the
Court of Surveyors in 1553, its establishment included two Auditors
of Prests, and although this court was itself merged in the Exchequer
under Mary, the more up-to-date methods of auditing were continued by
Elizabeth’s appointment in 1560, as themselves Exchequer officers, of
two ‘Auditores de lez Prestes et Compotorum forinsecorum nostrorum’.
The main difference between the methods of the Auditors of the Prests
and that of the Auditor-Baron appears to have been that the personal
appearance of the accountant was no longer necessary, who now himself
prepared in duplicate a balance sheet known as his Original Account,
or Book of Account, of which one copy was signed after examination and
returned to him as evidence of his quittance, while the other was kept
by the Auditors, who based upon it a summary known as the Declared or
Recorded Account, which took the place of the old <i>Compotus</i>.
This also was in duplicate. Apparently the Auditors kept one copy,
on paper, and sent another, on parchment, for preservation, as of
record, in the Pipe Office. I understand Miss George, however, to
think that the accountant was entitled to the paper copy, if he
chose to pay a fee for it, which he very often did not. The amount
of detail taken into the Declared Account from the Original Account
varied for different offices. The Revels Declared Accounts are very
summary; those of the Treasurer of the Chamber, at any rate as regards
play-payments, practically duplicates of the Original Accounts, except
that, unfortunately, the names of plays, which sometimes appeared in
the Original Accounts, are usually omitted. The Auditors also kept the
subsidiary documents submitted with the Original Account, and became
involved in a controversy, recorded in T. Fanshawe, <i>The Practice
of the Exchequer Court</i> (1658), with the King’s Remembrancer, who
claimed that they should come to him. The King’s Remembrancer did
apparently see the Declared Account on its way to the Pipe Office, and
enrolled it, or a further summary of it. About 1603 all the Household
accounts appear to have gone before the Auditors of the Prests, except
those of the Cofferer, which still followed the old course of the
Exchequer. The procedures here described explain the provenance of such
Household accounts as belong to the official repositories now united in
the Record Office; some others, preserved there or elsewhere, come from
the private archives of the accountants themselves, being either the
audit duplicates supplied to them, or office copies and drafts of their
own Original Accounts, or the journals, pay books, and ledgers from
which these were prepared.</p>


<h3>CHAMBER ACCOUNTS</h3>

<p>The following accounts appear to be extant.</p>

<h4>(a) <i>Mediaeval Period.</i></h4>

<p>A few accounts and subsidiary documents of the reigns of Edward II,
Edward III, and Richard II are included in the Foreign Accounts on the
Great Rolls of the Exchequer (<i>P. R. O. Lists and Indexes</i>, xi.
108, 109), and in the Exchequer Wardrobe and Household Accounts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span> (<i>L.
and I</i>. xxxv. 376, 379, 380, 382, 386, 391, 392, 396, 540). The
earliest are described, with extracts, by J. C. Davies, <i>The First
Journal of Edward II’s Chamber</i> (<i>E. H. R.</i> xxx. 662).</p>

<h4>(b) <i>Early Tudor Period.</i></h4>

<p>A number of accounts passed from the Augmentation Office to the
Exchequer and were amalgamated in 1839 with others from the office of
the King’s Remembrancer in a series of Exchequer Accounts, Various.
Here they are numbered 413 to 427. They are mainly accounts of
revenue and subsidiary documents, but a few accounts of payments
presented to the Record Office by the Trevelyan family have been added
to the series, and with them are listed as Wardrobe and Household
Accounts (<i>L. and I.</i> xxxv) some other payment accounts from
the Miscellaneous Books of the Treasury of Receipt of the Exchequer,
and one from the Miscellaneous Books of the Court of Augmentations.
Other payment accounts are in the British Museum and in unofficial
collections. It may be the case, as Newton, 359, suggests, that these
or some of them were abstracted from the Records by officials of
antiquarian tastes, but it must be remembered that duplicates even of
audited accounts were often kept by the accountants. These accounts are
generally known as The King’s Books of Payments. The following can be
traced:</p>

<h5>i. <i>Accounts of John Heron.</i></h5>

<p>Three Books of Payments, for 1505–9, 1509–18, and 1518–21 respectively,
with many royal signatures by way of audit, are now in the P. R.
O. (<i>Misc. Books of Treasury of Receipt</i>, 214, 215, 216). The
contents of the Henry VIII books are abstracted in Brewer, ii. 1441;
iii. 1533. There must once have been an earlier book, for Collier, i.
49, 52, 76, gives extracts from one for 1492–1505, which he describes
as ‘formerly in the Chapter-house, Westminster’, as well as from
the three now extant, which he describes as ‘in the Chapter-house’.
Possibly this was <i>Addl. MS.</i> 21480, which has been traced back
(Newton, 359) through the hands of Craven Ord (a friend of Collier)
and Thomas Astle to those of Peter Le Neve, a Deputy-Chamberlain of
the Exchequer. But <i>Addl. MS.</i> 21481, which also came from Le
Neve, is a duplicate of the R. O. books for 1505–18, and therefore
<i>Addl. MS.</i> 21480 may only have been a duplicate of the missing
volume. Both the <i>Addl. MSS.</i> contain the royal signatures. Craven
Ord made some extracts which are now <i>Addl. MSS.</i> 7099, 7100,
and to these those supplied by Astle to R. Henry, <i>History of Great
Britain</i>, vi (1793), app., and those in S. Bentley, <i>Excerpta
Historica</i> (1831), 85, owe their origin. Collier, i. 49, also cites
a small book for 1501–2 kept (perhaps under Heron) by one Robert
Fowler, which refers to parallel payments made by Thomas Trollop.</p>

<h5>ii. <i>Accounts of Brian Tuke.</i></h5>

<p>A book signed monthly by Henry VIII, with some entries from 31 Dec.
1528 to 30 June 1529, but mainly covering the period from 17 Nov.
1529 to 29 Dec. 1532, was printed by N. H. Nicolas from a MS.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
then in his possession as <i>The Privy Purse Expenses of Henry the
Eighth</i> (1827) and misdescribed as an account of the Treasurer of
the Household. Presumably this MS. is identical with that owned by
Sir O. Bridgeman in 1634 and now <i>Addl. MS.</i> 20030. It overlaps
with an account for 1 Oct. 1528 to May 1531, presented by Sir W. C.
Trevelyan to the P. R. O. (<i>Exchequer Accounts, Various</i>, 420/11);
extracts are given in <i>Trevelyan Papers</i> (C. S.), i. 136, and
an abstract in Brewer, v. 303. Collier, i. 116, and Nicolas (<i>ut
supra</i>), xxviii, give extracts from an account for Feb. 1538 to June
1541 in the possession of the Royal Society, presumably a duplicate of
the account for the same period in <i>Arundel MS.</i> 97, incorrectly
catalogued by the B.M. as an account of the Treasurer of the Household,
and abstracted in Brewer, xiii. 2. 524; xiv. 2. 303; xvi. 178, 698. An
account for May to Sept. 1542 in <i>Stowe MS.</i> 554 is abstracted in
Brewer, xvii. 474. Collier, i. 117, gives extracts from an account for
1543–4 in Craven Ord’s collection.</p>

<h5>iii. <i>Accounts of William Cavendish.</i></h5>

<p>Account for 31 March 1547 to 31 Sept. 1549, of which extracts are given
in <i>Trevelyan Papers</i>, i. 191, ii. 13, were presented by Sir W. C.
Trevelyan to the P. R. O. (<i>Exchequer Accounts, Various</i>, 426/5,
6). <i>Misc. Exch. Augm.</i> 439 for 1547–8 is referred to by Newton,
359, as a Chamber account, and is presumably a duplicate.</p>

<h5>iv. <i>Account of Edmund Felton.</i></h5>

<p>A Declared Account for 1 Apr. to 31 Dec. 1557 is in <i>D. A. Pipe
Office</i>, 541. Stopes, <i>Hunnis</i>, 145, cites a ‘Compotus
Marie Rither and Edmond Felton’ for 5 and 6 Edw. VI (<i>Queen’s
Remembrancia</i>, 77/5) as a Chamber Account. It is doubtless a
Cofferer’s Account.</p>

<h4>(c) <i>Elizabethan and Jacobean Periods.</i></h4>

<h5>i. <i>Accounts in P. R. O.</i></h5>

<p>The P. R. O. contains Chamber Accounts in four forms. Original
Accounts, as submitted for audit, are in <i>Audit Office, Accounts
Various</i>, 3/127–9. These are no doubt the ‘very incomplete’ set from
which extracts are given by Cunningham, xxvii. So far as play-payments
are concerned, they do not appear to be more detailed than the Declared
Accounts annually drawn up from them by the auditors, of which there
are duplicate sets, both nearly complete, belonging respectively
to the Audit Office and to the Pipe Office in the Lord Treasurer’s
Remembrancer’s Department of the Exchequer. They cover the terms of
office of Mason (1558–66), Knollys (1566–70), Heneage (1570–95),
Killigrew (1595–6), and Stanhope (1596–1617). From the Pipe Office
series I supplemented Cunningham’s extracts in <i>M. L. R.</i> ii
(1906), 1; iv (1909), 153, and give a complete record of play-payments
below. The payments are also given for 1558–85 from the Audit Office
series in Wallace, i (1912), 210, and very imperfectly from the Pipe
Office series for 1559–97 in Stopes, <i>Hunnis</i>, 318. Finally,
there are Enrolled Accounts in the King’s Remembrancer’s Department
(Scargill-Bird<sup>1</sup>, liv). A single book for 1569–70 is in the same
Department (<i>Exchequer Accounts, Various</i>, 430/15). It appears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span> to
be an office book, and has some original signatures by way of receipts
for payments.</p>

<h5>ii. <i>Accounts in British Museum.</i></h5>

<p><i>Harl.</i> 1641 and 1642 are duplicates of Heneage’s accounts for
1585–6 and 1593–4 as prepared for audit. <i>Harl.</i> 1644 is an office
book, 1581–3, containing signatures by way of receipts for wages and
the like.</p>

<h5>iii. <i>Accounts in Bodleian.</i></h5>

<p><i>Rawlinson MS.</i> A. 204, ff. 212, 269, contains duplicates of
Stanhope’s accounts for 1604–5 and 1610–11 as prepared for audit, and
<i>Rawlinson MSS.</i> A. 239 and 240 (formerly <i>Pepys MSS.</i> 78 and
79) are similar duplicates of his accounts for 1612–13 and 1616–17.
They are possibly office drafts, with some notes by a checking officer
or an auditor, but are not signed either by accountant or auditors.
Occasionally they are slightly more detailed as regards play entries
than the Declared Accounts. Thus in 1610–11 and 1612–13 they give
some dates of performances instead of the mere number for the season,
and in 1612–13 they even give the titles of the plays. Extracts of
these titles are given in Halliwell-Phillipps, ii. 87, and <i>N. S. S.
Trans.</i> (1875–6) 419, and more completely below. Similar entries
are given by P. Cunningham in <i>Sh. Soc. Papers</i>, ii. 123, not
direct from the manuscript, but from notes taken therefrom by Vertue
and Oldys. These had passed, in the case of the Oldys notes through
Percy, to Steevens, and from him to Hazlewood, who had copied them, as
Oldys and Steevens had done, into an interleaved Langbaine. Malone had
already used Vertue’s notes.</p>

<p>I should add that many ‘declarations’ or memoranda on the business of
the Treasurer of the Chamber and the state of his finances from time
to time are to be found in the Domestic State Papers, in Lansdowne and
other B.M. MSS., and in a volume (<i>Lord Steward’s Misc.</i> 301)
collected by Sir J. Caesar.</p>


<h3>REVELS ACCOUNTS</h3>

<p>The following accounts appear to be extant:</p>

<h4>(a) <i>Early Tudor Period.</i></h4>

<h5>(i) <i>Accounts of Richard Gibson.</i></h5>

<p>Brewer, ii. 1490; iii. 35, 1548; iv. 418, 837, 1390, 1392, 1415, 1603,
3073, gives abstracts of a series of accounts, ranging from 1510 to
1530, some or all of which are presumably taken from <i>Miscellaneous
Books of the Treasury of the Receipt of the Exchequer</i>, 217, 228,
229.</p>

<h5>(ii) <i>Accounts of John Bridges.</i></h5>

<p>It appears from extracts given by Kempe, 69, that some accounts of John
Bridges between 1539, when he became Yeoman of the Revels, and 1544,
when Cawarden became Master, are at Loseley.</p>

<h5>(iii) <i>Accounts of Sir Thomas Cawarden.</i></h5>

<p>Many of these are at Loseley, often in more than one copy. Kempe, 69,
gives a few extracts for the last years of Henry VIII, and the most
important documents for the next three reigns, ranging from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span> 1547 to
1559; are printed by A. Feuillerat in <i>Materialien</i>, xxi and xliv,
with accompanying warrants and other subsidiary documents. From 1547
to 1550 the accounts are mainly office copies of ‘particular’ books,
setting out the details and cost of each individual revel, airing, or
the like; but for 1550–55, and again for 1555–9, the ‘particular paye
bookes’ are brought together with summaries in two great ‘Certificates’
(<i>Loseley MSS.</i> 62 and 63), which relate to the Tents as well as
the Revels. The second of these includes, as well as money accounts,
inventories of the office stuff and notes of its employment in masking
and other garments during 1555–60, and a similar record for 1550–5 is
in <i>Loseley MS.</i> 112. These Certificates, although signed by the
Clerk, Clerk Controller, and Yeoman, are not audited. Probably they are
office copies of Original Accounts prepared for audit.</p>

<h4>(b) <i>Elizabethan Period.</i></h4>

<p>Eleven Original Accounts of the Masters or Acting Masters of the
Revels, with annotations by the Auditors, are in <i>R. O. Audit
Office, Accounts Various</i>, 3, 907 (formerly 1213). They relate to
the periods: (i) Feb. 1571–May 1572; (ii) June 1572–Oct. 1573; (iii)
Nov. 1573–Feb. 1574; (iv) March 1574–Feb. 1575; (v) March 1576–Feb.
1577; (vi) Feb. 1578–Oct. 1579; (vii) Nov. 1579–Oct. 1580; (viii) Nov.
1580–Oct. 1581; (ix) Nov. 1582–Oct. 1583; (x) Nov. 1584–Oct. 1585; (xi)
Nov. 1587–Oct. 1588. It will be seen that a regular annual system,
starting with the opening of the season for revels at All Saints in
each year, was ultimately adopted. All these accounts were printed in
P. Cunningham, <i>Extracts from the Accounts of the Revels at Court</i>
(1842, <i>Sh. Soc.</i>), but (ii) imperfectly and (xi) from an
unaudited duplicate in the same bundle. These vagaries are corrected in
the text of Feuillerat (1908, <i>Materialien</i>, xxi), who also gives
an account for Nov. 1587–Oct. 1589 from <i>Lansd. MS.</i> 59, f. 38,
which in part duplicates (xi), and much illustrative matter, including
an estimate in some detail of the expenditure from Christmas 1563 to
Shrovetide 1565 from <i>S. P. Dom. Eliz.</i> xxxvi. 22. The Audit
Office series of Declared Accounts for the Revels is imperfect, but
contains two, printed by Feuillerat, for the years 1581–2 and 1583–4,
for which there are no Original Accounts. The Pipe Office series
appears to be complete.</p>

<h4>(c) <i>Jacobean Period.</i></h4>

<p>There are only two Original Accounts, for 1604–5 and 1611–12, which are
printed by Cunningham. The Pipe Office Declared Accounts are complete.
I have not examined those of the Audit Office. The Original Accounts
for 1604–5 and 1611–12, and especially the former, have been the
subject of a good deal of controversy. The facts are as follows. They
were printed in 1842 by Peter Cunningham, then a clerk in the Audit
Office, who described them as a separate discovery from the Elizabethan
bundle, which he also printed. Twenty-six years afterwards, in 1868, he
attempted to sell them to the British Museum, stating that he had found
them some thirty years before ‘under the vaults of Somerset House&mdash;far
under the Quadrangle in a dry and lofty cellar, known by the name of
the “Charcoal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span> Repository”’. Their official character was realized,
and they were sent to the Record Office, and placed amongst the papers
known as <i>Audit Office, Accounts Various</i>, 3, 908 (formerly 1214),
with a note that Mr. E. A. Bond, Keeper of the Manuscripts in the
British Museum, ‘saw reasons for doubting the genuineness of one, at
least, of these papers, from the peculiar character of the writing and
the spelling’. It is probable that Bond had in mind, wholly or mainly,
the play-list of the 1604–5 book, which does use some spellings, such
as ‘Shaxberd’ and ‘aleven’, which are unusual although by no means
unparalleled, and is, moreover, in a style of handwriting sufficiently
different from the rest of the document to have at first sight a
suspicious air. But it is an integral part of the book, occupying ff.
2, 2<sup>v</sup> of its three small folio sheets, with other matter both on ff.
1, 1<sup>v</sup>, and on ff. 5, 5<sup>v</sup>, which form the second half of its sheet, and
therefore, if a forged insertion, it occupies a long blank conveniently
left by the original scribe just where, according to Revels practice,
such a list ought to come. Bond’s scepticism was shared by Sir Thomas
Duffus Hardy, and although the grounds of it did not extend beyond the
play-list in the 1604–5 account, the acceptance of this as a forgery
naturally reflected some suspicion upon the corresponding list for
1611–12. The position, however, called for some reconsideration when,
in <i>A Note on Measure for Measure</i> (1880) and subsequently in the
fifth edition (1885) of his <i>Outlines</i> (ed. 9, ii. 163, 309),
Halliwell-Phillipps called attention to evidence that Malone, at some
date before his death in 1812, and therefore before Cunningham was
born, was acquainted at least with the substance of the 1604–5 list.
The Bodleian contains a number of Malone’s note-books, which are
believed to have been purchased from Mr. Rodd, a London bookseller,
in 1838, and contain material collected after the issue of Malone’s
<i>Shakespeare</i> of 1790 with a view to a second edition ultimately
produced by Boswell in 1821. With them were a bundle of loose scraps,
which have since been mounted and bound as a supplementary volume.
One of these scraps (<i>Malone MS.</i> 29, f. 69<sup>v</sup>) consists of a
list of plays headed ‘1604 &amp; 1605 Ed<sup>d</sup>. Tylney’, which substantially
agrees with the list in the Revels book, even to the unusual spelling
‘Shaxberd’, although it is clearly not a transcript of the Revels list,
but merely an abstract of this, or a similar document, in an unknown
hand other than Malone’s. One of the plays named in the Revels book,
<i>The Spanish Maze</i> of Shrove Monday, is omitted. No use of the
scrap had been made by Boswell, although he prints (<i>Variorum</i>,
iii. 360) extracts made by Malone from the Elizabethan Revels books,
together with a letter of 7 Nov. 1591 from Sir William Musgrave, of
the Audit Office, inviting Malone to inspect them, and an official
memorandum on the ‘State of the Books of Accounts and Records of the
Master of the Revels, still remaining in the Office for Auditing the
Public Accounts in 1791’. It is, I think, inconceivable that, if the
Jacobean as well as the Elizabethan books had then been discovered,
no reference should have been made to them either by Musgrave or
Malone, and the most probable explanation of the Bodleian scrap is
that the Jacobean books turned up later, and that an abstract of the
1604–5 list was then prepared for the use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span> of Malone. It is true that
in that case the Jacobean books would naturally have been added to
the ‘proper presses’ which Musgrave says that he had provided for the
Elizabethan ones, whereas Cunningham found the two sets apart. But as
Cunningham also says that he had redeemed the Elizabethan bundle from
‘a destructive oblivion’, it is possible that Musgrave’s successors had
been neglectful. Moreover, although the 1604–5 list does not appear in
the 1821 <i>Variorum</i>, it is difficult to see on what other grounds
Malone can have stated of <i>Othello</i> (<i>Variorum</i>, ii. 404),
‘We know that it was acted in 1604’. Probably, indeed, he had seen the
list, before he abandoned in a note of 1800 to Dryden’s <i>Grounds of
Criticism in Tragedy</i> his earlier opinion that <i>Othello</i> was
one of Shakespeare’s latest plays. Further, there is similar indirect
evidence that he had also come across the 1611–12 list. In 1808 he
privately printed and in 1809 published an <i>Account of the ...
Tempest</i>, written ‘some years ago’. The chief object of this was
to fix an inferior date by Shakespeare’s use of a pamphlet of 1610.
The superior date he took for granted, saying (p. 31) ‘That it was
performed before the middle of 1611, we have already seen’, and adding
the foot-note ‘Under a former article’. There was no former article,
but in the preface Malone describes the essay as making ‘a part of
the Disquisition concerning the order of the plays in an enlarged
form’, and no doubt the former article would have been included in
the disquisition, had Malone ever completed his own work. Boswell,
reprinting the essay in <i>Variorum</i>, xv. 414, altered the foot-note
to refer to the essay on the Chronological Order of Shakespeare’s Plays
in ‘vol. i’. This is in fact in vol. ii, but though Boswell here states
(ii. 465) that there is evidence that the <i>Tempest</i> ‘was produced
in 1611’, he does not give any evidence beyond the pamphlet of 1610.
Probably he did not know everything that Malone knew. But how did
Malone arrive at ‘the middle of 1611’, since the 1604–5 list does not
take us beyond 1 Nov. 1611? I suppose he assumed that public production
preceded performance at court. Later in the essay (<i>Variorum</i>, xv.
423) he says that the play ‘had a being and a name in the autumn of
1611’.</p>

<p>Since Halliwell-Phillipps’s discovery the prevalent view, suggested by
him, has been that if the lists, or at any rate that of 1604–5, are
forged, the forger had before him a genuine original. More recently,
however, the matter has been fully investigated by Mr. Ernest Law, who
stimulated the Record Office to a minute examination of the 1604–5
document, including chemical and microscopical tests of the ink
conducted by Professor J. J. Dobbie at the Government Laboratories.
As a result, Mr. Law’s own view that the list is genuine is confirmed
by such high palaeographical authorities as Sir George Warner of the
British Museum and Sir Henry Maxwell Lyte, Mr. Scargill-Bird, and other
officers of the Record Office, as well as by Professor Feuillerat,
than whom no one knows the Revels documents better, and Professor
Wallace. Mr. Law set out the evidence and the whole history of the
case in <i>Some Supposed Shakespeare Forgeries</i> (1911). His view
was controverted in a review and a number of subsequent communications
in the <i>Athenaeum</i> for 1911 (i. 638; ii. 101, 131, 421) and 1912
(i. 469,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span> 654; ii. 142) by a writer using the signature ‘Audi Alteram
Partem’, whose rather amazing contentions Mr. Law disposed of in the
same periodical (1911, ii. 297, 324, 388; 1912, i. 390, 470) and in
<i>More about Shakespeare Forgeries</i> (1913). A recent controversy
between Mrs. C. C. Stopes, Mr. Law, and Sir E. M. Thompson (<i>T. L.
S.</i> 2, 23, 30 Dec. 1920; 27 Jan., 10, 24 Feb. 1921) has led to no
different result.</p>

<p>I do not think that, in view of the palaeographical investigation, it
is any longer possible to reject the genuineness of the 1604–5 list,
and although that of 1611–12 has not been so minutely tested, it is
pretty obviously of a piece with the ‘Book’ of which it forms a part,
and had it stood alone, probably no suspicion would have fallen upon
it. In fact, it would really be more plausible&mdash;although this also is
not in the least plausible&mdash;to take the whole documents as forgeries,
than to take the lists as forged insertions in genuine accounts.</p>

<p>It must be added that there are some singular things about the
substance of the books, with which Mr. Law does not seem to me quite
to grapple. On the whole, that of 1604–5 is rather less perplexing
than that of 1611–12. But the scribe has been oddly confused about his
dates. On f. 1<sup>v</sup> he has written ‘iij<sup>o</sup>’, instead of ‘ij<sup>o</sup>’ for the
regnal year. And at the top of f. 2 he has apparently written ‘1605’
and then corrected it to ‘1604’. The Queen’s Revels are called by
their obsolete name of ‘The Boyes of the Chapell’, which is odd in an
official document, but so they are, much later, in the Treasurer of the
Chamber’s account for 1612–13. It is more important that, while the
Treasurer of the Chamber records payments for two plays to the Queen’s
Revels, one on 1 Jan. and the other on 3 Jan., the Revels list omits
the play on 3 Jan. altogether, and instead records a performance of
<i>Love’s Labour’s Lost</i> by the King’s men ‘betwin Newers Day and
Twelfe Day’. No complete explanation of this is possible. The most that
can be said is that there is independent evidence of a performance
of <i>Love’s Labour’s Lost</i> in Jan. 1605, but at a date after
and not before Twelfth Night. This is derived from two letters. The
first is from Sir Walter Cope to Robert Cecil, Viscount Cranborne,
preserved at Hatfield (<i>Hist. MSS.</i> iii. 148) and printed by
Halliwell-Phillipps, ii. 83:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘I have sent and bene all thys morning huntyng for players
juglers and such kinde of creaturs, but fynde them harde to
fynde; wherfore, leavinge notes for them to seeke me, Burbage
ys come, and sayes ther ys no new playe that the Quene hath not
seene, but they have revyved an olde one cawled <i>Loves Labore
lost</i>, which for wytt and mirthe he sayes will please her
excedingly. And thys ys apointed to be playd tomorowe night
at my Lord of Sowthamptons, unless yow send a wrytt to remove
the corpus cum causa to your howse in Strande. Burbage ys my
messenger ready attendyng your pleasure.’</p>
</div>

<p>The letter is undated, but endorsed ‘1604’. Cecil’s title was Viscount
Cranborne from 20 Aug. 1604 to 4 May 1605. A second letter, from Dudley
Carleton to John Chamberlain on 15 Jan. 1605 (<i>S. P. D. Jac. I</i>,
xii. 13) gives within near limits the date of the performance. Carleton
says,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘It seems we shall have Christmas all the yeare and therefore I
shall never be owt of matter. The last nights revels were kept
at my Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span> of Cranbornes, where the Q. with the D. of Holst and
a great part of the Court were feasted, and the like two nights
before at my Lord of Southamptons. The Temples have both of them
done somewhat since Twelftide but nothing memorable, save that
it was observed on Friday last at night the greatest part of the
femal audience was the sisterhoode of Blackfriers.’</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Law (<i>More about S. F.</i> 50) rightly rejects the suggestion of
‘Audi Alteram Partem’ that the ‘last night’ referred to was necessarily
14 Jan., the night before the date of Carleton’s letter; but I think
he is wrong in taking it as the last night of Christmas. This, of
course, was traditionally Twelfth Night, the day in 1605 of Jonson’s
<i>Mask of Blackness</i>. But surely Carleton’s whole point lies in
the exceptional prolongation of the Christmas festivities of this year
beyond Twelfth Night, and I feel clear that all the revels he here
refers to fell between 6 and 15 Jan. On 7 and 8 Jan. came <i>Hen. V</i>
and <i>E. M. O.</i> Putting the facts together, we get a performance,
either at Southampton’s house or Cranborne’s, between 8 and 15 Jan. of
<i>Love’s Labour’s Lost</i>, which the Queen had not seen before. It
is not therefore at all likely that there had been another performance
of the same play at court between 1 and 6 Jan. It is true that the
Queen might by some accident have missed such a performance. But that
would not have prevented the Treasurer of the Chamber from paying for
it, whereas he would not pay for a performance ordered as part of an
entertainment given by Southampton or Cranborne. Nor would it have been
the duty of the Revels Office to attend such a performance, which makes
it rather mystifying that they should have confused it with the second
Queen’s Revels performance at court some days earlier, which it would
have been their duty to attend. The vagueness of the phrase ‘betwin
Newers Day and Twelfe Day’, suggesting that the list was prepared
retrospectively from memory, when the account was made up in the autumn
of 1605, may perhaps help to explain an error. On the other hand, a
forger, presumably knowing nothing of Cope’s letter, which first came
to light in 1872, could hardly have guessed at a revival of <i>Love’s
Labour’s Lost</i> in 1605.</p>

<p>The discrepancies between the Revels list of 1611–12 and the
corresponding accounts of the Treasurer of the Chamber are rather
numerous. The Revels list records thirteen plays from 1 Nov. to 25
Feb. ‘before the Kinges Maiestie’, including two which, although, I
suppose, ordered for the King, were in fact only given before the Queen
and Prince. The Treasurer paid for only ten plays as before the King,
and for many others before the younger members of the royal family
only, with which the Revels would not normally be concerned. The two
records agree as to 1 and 5 Nov., 26, 27, and 29 Dec., and 2, 23, and
25 Feb. On 28 Dec. the Treasurer notes a play by the Prince’s men which
the Revels list does not. On 1 Jan. the Revels list notes a play by
the King’s men, which the Treasurer does not. The play on 5 Jan. is
assigned by the Treasurer to the King’s men, and by the Revels list to
the Whitefriars. The plays on 12 and 13 Jan. appear from the Revels
list to have been joint performances by the King’s and Queen’s men, but
the Treasurer notes the play on 12 Jan. only, assigns that to the Duke
of York’s men,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span> and refers to Henry but not to the Queen as present.
He also paid for one play by the King’s men before Henry, of which he
does not give the date, and which may be that of 13 Jan. Both records
note a play by the Duke of York’s men on 24 Feb., but while the Revels
list does not indicate that James was absent, the Treasurer treats the
performance as one before the royal children only. I do not know that
all this is beyond the blundering of the clerks concerned, especially
perhaps the Clerk of the Revels, at a time when the functions of the
office in relation to court plays had become trivial. On the other
hand, I am not clear that plays ordered by the Queen and paid for out
of her privy purse, instead of by the Treasurer of the Chamber, may not
sometimes have been produced under Revels Office auspices; if so, some
of the discrepancies might be thus accounted for. But obviously the
facts necessitate some caution in the use of the 1611–12 list.</p>


<h3>ABSTRACT OF PAYMENTS</h3>

<p>I now give in tabular form an abstract of all entries in the Chamber
and Revels accounts, which enable us to establish the succession of
court performances during 1558–1616. These are arranged under years
running from Michaelmas to Michaelmas. Four columns are devoted to the
Chamber Accounts. Col. 1 records the dates of the performances, as
recorded in the Declared Accounts. Any correction or closer information
as to date derivable from other sources is added in square brackets.
For the Jacobean period I also show the personages before whom the
performances were given, K. standing for James, Q. for Anne, H. for
Henry, C. for Charles, E. for the Princess Elizabeth, and F. for the
Elector Palatine. Col. 2 contains the verbatim descriptions in the
accounts of the companies performing and their payees, and in a very
few cases of the nature of the performances. A few miscellaneous
entries are inserted in this column. Probably an exhaustive examination
of the records of the subordinate royal households during 1603–16
might enable a few additions to be made. It is also possible that an
occasional play, perhaps on a progress, may have been rewarded out of
the Privy Purse. But the main series of performances provided for the
regular winter ‘solace’ of the sovereign appears to be fairly complete.
Col. 3 shows the amounts of the rewards. Col. 4 adds the dates of the
warrants for payment as given in the Declared Accounts and in brackets
the places where they were made out, W. for Westminster, H. for Hampton
Court, G. for Greenwich, R. for Richmond, J. for St. James’s, Wi. for
Windsor. I add references to the parallel extracts of Cunningham from
the Original Chamber Accounts (C.), and to the notes of the signing of
warrants in the Privy Council Register (D.) where these exist. A fifth
column, for certain years, adds the relevant extracts from such Revels
Accounts as survive. The references are to Feuillerat’s edition. Any
discrepancies of importance between Chamber, Privy Council, and Revels
records are dealt with in foot-notes. The variant dates of warrants in
the ill-kept Privy Council Register are not important.</p>

<span class="subhed">DOCUMENTS OF CRITICISM</span></h2></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[There is much vain repetition in learned controversy, whether
literary or ethical. I have attempted, by extract or summary,
to indicate the main critical positions taken up by writers of
different schools with regard to plays, and at the same time
to preserve the incidental information which they furnish on
points of stage history. It does not seem to me necessary to do
more than cite, as of minor importance, and practically adding
nothing, T. Becon, <i>The Catechisme</i> (1564, <i>Works</i>,
i, f. cccccxxxii); E. Hake, <i>Merry Maidens of London</i>
(1567), <i>A Touchstone for this Time</i> (1574), sig. G
4<sup>v</sup>; E. Dering, <i>Catechisme for Householders</i> (1572);
T. Brasbridge, <i>Poor Man’s Jewel</i> (1578); R. Crowley,
<i>Unlawful Practises of Prelates</i> (&gt; 1583), sig. B 3<sup>v</sup>; N.
Bownde, <i>Doctrine of the Sabbath</i> (1595), 211; J. Norden,
<i>Progress of Piety</i> (1596, ed. <i>Parker Soc.</i>), 177;
T. Beard, <i>Theatre of God’s Judgments</i> (1597), 193, 197,
374; W. Vaughan, <i>The Golden Grove</i> (1600), i. 51; F.
Hering, <i>Rules for the Prevention of the Sickness</i> (1603),
sig. A 4<sup>v</sup>; R. Knolles, <i>Six Books of a Commonweal</i>
(1606, from J. Bodin, <i>Six Livres de la République</i>,
1576–8, 1601), vi. 1; W. Perkins, <i>Cases of Conscience</i>
(1608, ed. T. Pickering), 118; R. Bolton, <i>Discourse of True
Happiness</i> (1611), 73; L. Bayly, <i>Practice of Piety</i>
(<i>c.</i> 1612, ed. Webster, 1842), 182, 190; O. Lake, <i>Probe
Theologicall upon the Commandments</i> (1612), 267; J. Dod and
R. Cleaver, <i>Exposition of the Ten Commandments</i> (1612);
G. Wither, <i>Abuses Stript and Whipt</i> (1613), ii. 3; D.
Dyke, <i>Michael and the Dragon</i> (1615), 216. Probably such
references could be multiplied indefinitely; they show how dread
of the stage became a commonplace of pastoral theology. Thomas
Spark’s <i>Rehearsal Sermon</i> (1579) is only known from the
citation of it by Munday (cf. No. xxvii, <i>infra</i>).]</p>

<h3>i. 1489 (?). <span class="smcap">Desiderius Erasmus.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[From <i>Epistola</i> 31, to an unnamed friend (P. S. Allen,
<i>Opus Epistolarum Des. Erasmi Roterodami</i>, i. 123),
conjecturally dated by Mr. Allen in 1489. Erasmus more briefly
commends the educational use both of Terence and Plautus in
<i>De Ratione Studii</i> (1511, <i>Opera</i>, i. 521). In 1532
he edited Terence, and to the same year belongs <i>Epist.</i>
1238 (<i>Opera</i>, iii. 2, 1457), which praises the comedies
without re-arguing at length the ethical controversy; cf. W. H.
Woodward, <i>Desiderius Erasmus concerning the Aim and Method of
Education</i> (1904), 28, 39, 113, 164.]</p>

mali), rapientes, non vident quanta illic sit moralitas, quanta vitae
instituendae tacita exhortatio, quanta sententiarum venustas. Neque
intelligunt totum hoc scripti genus ad coarguenda mortalium vitia
accommodatum, imo adeo inuentum. Quid enim sunt comoediae, nisi seruus
nugator, adolescens amore insanus, meretrix blanda ac procax, senex
difficilis, morosus, auarus? Haec nobis in fabulis, perinde atque
in tabula, proponuntur depicta; vt, quum in moribus hominum quid
deceat, quid dedeceat, viderimus, alterum amemus alterum castigemus.
En, in Eunucho Phaedria ille ex summa continentia in summam ineptiam
amore, tanquam morbo validissimo, immutatus, adeo vt eundem esse non
cognoscas; quam pulchro exemplo docet amorem rem esse et miserrimam et
anxiam, instabilem et prorsus insaniae turpissimae plenam. Assentatores
istos, pestilens hominum genus, Gnatonem suum, artis suae principem,
spectare iubeto. Iactabundi et sibi placentes, quales diuitum
plerosque imperitos videmus, Thrasonem suum spectent ac tandem cum sua
magnificentia quam ridiculi sint intelligant.</p>

<p>Sed de his latius (quum [quae] de litteris scripsimus edemus)
nostra leges, volente quidem Deo. Ad praesentem locum satis fuerit
tetigisse comoedias Terentianas; modo recte legantur, non modo non ad
subuertendos mores, verum etiam ad corrigendos maximopere valere, certe
ad Latine discendum plane necessarias iudicauerim. An potius istud
ex Catholicon, Huguitione, Ebrardo, Papia caeterisque ineptioribus
sperare iubebunt? Mirum vero si his authoribus quis quid Latine dicat,
cum ipsi nihil non barbare locuti sint. Huiusmodi amplectatur, qui
balbutire volet; qui loqui cupiet, Terentium dicat, quem Cicero, quem
Quintilianus, quem Hieronymus, quem Augustinus, quem Ambrosius et
iuuenes didicere et senes vsi sunt; quem denique nemo, nisi barbarus,

<p>‘They whiche be ignoraunt in poetes wyll perchaunce obiecte, as is
their maner, agayne these verses [Horace, <i>Epist.</i> ii. 1. 126–31],
sayeng that in Therence and other that were writers of comedies,
also Ouide, Catullus, Martialis, and all that route of lasciuious
poetes that wrate epistles and ditties of loue, some called in latine
<i>Elegiæ</i> and some <i>Epigrammata</i>, is nothyng contayned but
incitation to lechery.</p>

<p>First, comedies, whiche they suppose to be a doctrinall of rybaudrie,
they be undoutedly a picture or as it were a mirrour of man’s life,
wherin iuell is nat taught but discouered; to the intent that men
beholdynge the promptnes of youth unto vice, the snares of harlotts
and baudes laid for yonge myndes, the disceipte of seruantes, the
chaunces of fortune contrary to mennes expectation, they beinge therof
warned may prepare them selfe to resist or preuente occasion. Semblably
remembring the wisedomes, aduertisements, counsailes, dissuasion from
vice, and other profitable sentences, most eloquently and familiarely
shewed in those comedies, undoubtedly there shall be no litle frute
out of them gathered. And if the vices in them expressed shulde be
cause that myndes of the reders shulde be corrupted: than by the
same argumente nat only entreludes in englisshe, but also sermones,
wherin some vice is declared, shulde be to the beholders and herers
like occasion to encreace sinners.’ Quotes Terence, <i>Eunuchus</i>,
v. 4. 8–18, on the moral end of comedy and virtuous counsel from
Plautus, <i>Amphitruo</i>, ii. 2. 17–21; Ovid, <i>Remedia Amoris</i>,
131–6; and Martial, <i>Epigr.</i> xii. 34. ‘Wherfore sens good and
wise mater may be picked out of these poetes, it were no reason, for
some lite mater that is in their verses, to abandone therefore al
their warkes, no more than it were to forbeare or prohibite a man to
come into a faire gardein, leste the redolent sauours of swete herbes
and floures shall meue him to wanton courage, or leste in gadringe
good and holsome herbes he may happen to be stunge with a nettile.
No wyse man entreth in to a gardein but he sone espiethe good herbes
from nettiles, and treadeth the nettiles under his feete whiles he
gadreth good herbes. Wherby he taketh no damage, or if he be stungen
he maketh lite of it and shortly forgetteth it. Semblablye if he do
rede wanton mater mixte with wisedome, he putteth the warst under foote
and sorteth out the beste, or, if his courage be stered or prouoked,
he remembreth the litel pleasure and gret detriment that shulde ensue
of it, and withdrawynge his minde to some other studie or exercise
shortly forgetteth it.... So all thoughe I do nat approue the lesson of
wanton poetes to be taughte unto all children, yet thynke I conuenient
and necessary that, when the mynde is become constante and courage is
asswaged, or that children of their naturall disposition be shamfaste
and continent, none auncient poete wolde be excluded from the leesson
of suche one as desireth to come to the perfection of wysedome.’</p>

inde ab Adam vsque, primo humani generis parente. Omnino enim refertae
sunt hae historiae diuinis et heroicis personis, affectionibus,
moribus, actionibus, euentibus quoque inexpectatis, atque in contrarium
quam expectarentur cadentibus, quae Aristoteles vocat περιπετείας. Quae
omnia cum mirificam vim habeant fidem in Deum confirmandi, et amorem
studiumque Dei accendendi admirationem item pietatis atque iusticiae,
et horrorem impietatis, omnisque peruersitatis ingenerandi atque
augendi: quanto magis deceat Christianos, ut ex his sua poemata sumant,
quibus magna et illustria hominum consilia, conatus, ingenium, affectus
atque casus repraesentent, quam ex impiis ethnicorum vel fabulis vel
historiis! Adhibendae autem sunt in vtroque genere poematum, comico
et tragico, vt cum hominum vitia et peccata describuntur, et actione
quasi oculis conspicienda exhibentur, id fiat ea ratione, vt quamuis
perditorum hominum referantur scelera, tamen terror quidam in his
diuini iudicii, et horror appareat peccati: non exprimantur exultans in
scelere oblectatio, atque confidens audacia. Praestat hinc detrahere
aliquid decoro poetico, quam curae aedificandi pietate spectatores;
quae poscit vt in omni peccati repraesentatione sentiantur,
conscientiae propriae condemnatio, et a iudicio Dei horrenda trepidatio.</p>

<p>At dum piae et probae exhibentur actiones, in his debet exprimi
quam clarissime sensus divinae misericordiae laetus, securaque et
confidens, moderata tamen, et diffidens sibi exultansque in Deo fiducia
promissionum Dei cum sancta et spirituali in recte faciendo voluptate.
Hac enim ratione sanctorum et ingenia, et mores, et affectus, ad
instaurandam in populo omnem pietatem ac virtutem, quam scitissima
imitatione repraesentantur. Eum autem fructum vt Christi populus ex
sanctis comoediis et tragoediis percipiant praeficiendi et huic rei
erunt viri, vt horum poematum singulariter intelligentes, ita etiam
explorati et constantis studii in regnum Christi: ne qua omnino agatur
comoedia, aut tragoedia, quam hi non ante perspectam decreuerint
agendam.</p>

<p>Hi quoque curabunt, ne quid leue aut histrionicum in agendo admittatur:
sed omnia exhibeantur sancta quadam, et graui, iucunda tamen, sanctis
duntaxat, actione: qua repraesententur non tam res ipsae, et actiones
hominum, affectus et perturbationes, quam mores et ingenia: ac ita
repraesententur, vt excitetur in spectatoribus studiosa imitatio: eorum
autem quae secus sunt instituta et facta, confirmetur detestatio, et
excitetur declinatio vigilantior.</p>

<p>His observatis cautionibus, poterit sane multa, nec minus ad virtutem
alendam prouehendamque, vtilis ludendi materia iuuentuti praeberi,
maxime cum studium et cura eiusmodi et comoediarum et tragoediarum

et tragoediae, in quibus, etiamsi docti mundi huius desiderent in
comoediis illud acumen, eumque leporem, et sermonis venustatem, quem
admirantur in Aristophanis, Terentii, Plautique fabulis: in tragoediis,
grauitatem, versutiam, orationisque elegantiam, Sophoclis, Euripidis,
Senecae: docti tamen ad regnum Dei, et qui viuendi Deo sapientiam
discere student, non desiderant in his nostrorum hominum poematis

Dei. Optandum tamen, vt quibus Deus plus dedit in his rebus praestare,
vt id mallent ad eius gloriam explicare, quam aliorum pia studia

<p><i>The first booke teachyng the brynging vp of youth</i>.... P. 185.
In the earliest stage of Latin, Ascham ‘would haue the Scholer brought
vp withall, till he had red, &amp; translated ouer y<sup>e</sup> first booke of
[Cicero’s] Epistles chosen out by <i>Sturmius</i>, with a good peece
of a Comedie of <i>Terence</i> also.... P. 208. There be som seruing
men do but ill seruice to their yong masters. Yea, rede <i>Terence</i>
and <i>Plaut</i>. aduisedlie ouer, and ye shall finde in those two wise
writers, almost in euery commedie, no vnthriftie yong man, that is not
brought there vnto, by the sotle inticement of som lewd seruant. And
euen now in our dayes <i>Getae</i> and <i>Daui</i>, <i>Gnatos</i> and
manie bold bawdie <i>Phormios</i> to, be preasing in, to pratle on
euerie stage, to medle in euerie matter, when honest <i>Parmenos</i>
shall not be hard, but beare small swing with their masters....
<i>The second booke teachyng the ready way to the Latin tong</i>....
P. 238. Read dayly vnto him ... some Comedie of <i>Terence</i> or
<i>Plautus</i>: but in <i>Plautus</i>, skilfull choice must be vsed
by the master, to traine his Scholler to a iudgement, in cutting
out perfitelie ouer old and vnproper wordes.... On <i>Imitatio</i>
... P. 266. The whole doctrine of Comedies and Tragedies, is a
perfite <i>imitation</i>, or faire liuelie painted picture of the
life of euerie degree of man.... One of the best examples, for right
<i>Imitation</i> we lacke, and that is <i>Menander</i>, whom our
<i>Terence</i> (as the matter required) in like argument, in the same
Persons, with equall eloquence, foote by foote did follow. Som peeces
remaine, like broken Iewelles, whereby men may rightlie esteme, and
iustlie lament, the losse of the whole.... P. 276. In Tragedies,
(the goodliest Argument of all, and for the vse, either of a learned
preacher, or a Ciuill Ientleman, more profitable than <i>Homer</i>,
<i>Pindar</i>, <i>Vergill</i>, and <i>Horace</i>: yea comparable in
myne opinion, with the doctrine of <i>Aristotle</i>, <i>Plato</i>,
and <i>Xenophon</i>,) the <i>Grecians</i>, <i>Sophocles</i> and
<i>Euripides</i> far ouer match our <i>Seneca</i>, in <i>Latin</i>,
namely in οἱκονομία <i>et Decoro</i>, although <i>Senecaes</i>
elocution and verse be verie commendable for his tyme.’ ... P. 284.
Ascham describes some contemporary Latin tragedies.... P. 286. ‘Of this
short tyme of any pureness of the Latin tong, for the first fortie
yeare of it, and all the tyme before, we haue no peece of learning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
left, saue <i>Plautus</i> and <i>Terence</i>, with a litle rude
vnperfit pamflet of the elder <i>Cato</i>. And as for <i>Plautus</i>,
except the scholemaster be able to make wise and ware choice, first in
proprietie of wordes, then in framing of phrases and sentences, and
chieflie in choice of honestie of matter, your scholer were better
to play, then learne all that is in him. But surelie, if iudgement
for the tong, and direction for the maners, be wisely ioyned with the
diligent reading of <i>Plautus</i>, than trewlie <i>Plautus</i>, for
that purenesse of the Latin tong in Rome, whan Rome did most florish in
wel doing, and so thereby, in well speaking also, is soch a plentifull
storehouse, for common eloquence, in meane matters, and all priuate
mens affaires, as the Latin tong, for that respect, hath not the like
agayne. Whan I remember the worthy tyme of Rome, wherein <i>Plautus</i>
did liue, I must nedes honor the talke of that tyme, which we see
<i>Plautus</i> doth vse. <i>Terence</i> is also a storehouse of the
same tong, for an other tyme, following soone after, &amp; although he be
not so full &amp; plentiful as <i>Plautus</i> is, for multitude of matters,
&amp; diuersitie of wordes, yet his wordes, be chosen so purelie, placed so
orderly, and all his stuffe so neetlie packed vp, and wittely compassed
in euerie place, as, by all wise mens iudgement, he is counted the
cunninger workeman, and to haue his shop, for the rowme that is in it,
more finely appointed, and trimlier ordered, than <i>Plautus</i> is....
The matter in both, is altogether within the compasse of the meanest
mens maners, and doth not stretch to any thing of any great weight at
all, but standeth chiefly in vtteryng the thoughtes and conditions of
hard fathers, foolish mothers, vnthrifty yong men, craftie seruantes,
sotle bawdes, and wilie harlots, and so, is moch spent, in finding
out fine fetches, and packing vp pelting matters, soch as in London
commonlie cum to the hearing of the Masters of Bridewell. Here is base
stuffe for that scholer, that should becum hereafter, either a good
minister in Religion, or a Ciuill Ientleman in seruice of his Prince
and contrie: except the preacher do know soch matters to confute
them, whan ignorance surelie in all soch thinges were better for a
Ciuill Ientleman, than knowledge. And thus, for matter, both Plautus
and Terence, be like meane painters, that worke by halfes, and be
cunning onelie, in making the worst part of the picture, as if one
were skilfull in painting the bodie of a naked person, from the nauell
downward, but nothing else.’</p>

<p>P. 46. ‘Looke but vppon the common playes in London, and see the
multitude that flocketh to them and followeth them: beholde the
sumptuous Theatre houses, a continuall monument of Londons prodigalitie
and folly. But I vnderstande they are nowe forbidden bycause of the
plague. I like the pollicye well if it holde still, for a disease is

am ashamed, and I should surely offende your chast eares: but the olde

for, or some would beleeue, if I shold paint them out in their colours:
without doubt you can scantly name me a sinne, that by that sincke is
not set a gogge: theft and whoredome; pride and prodigality; villanie
and blasphemie; these three couples of helhoundes neuer cease barking
there, and bite manye, so as they are vncurable euer after, so that
many a man hath the leuder wife, and many a wife the shreuder husband
by it: and it can not otherwise be, but that whiche robbeth flatlye the
Lord of all his honor, and is directly against the whole first table of
his law, should make no bones of breache of the second also, which is
toward our neighbour only. Wherefore if thou be a father, thou losest
thy child: if thou be a maister, thou losest thy seruaunt; and thou be
what thou canst be, thou losest thy selfe that hauntest those scholes
of vice, dennes of theeues, and Theatres of all leudnesse: and if it be

second edition was printed in 1579. Northbrooke was a Gloucester
minister. The book was edited by J. P. Collier (1843, <i>Sh.
Soc.</i>).]</p>
</div>

<p>[Summary and Extracts.] The treatise is ‘made dialogue-wise’ between
Youth and Age. <i>Epistles</i> to Sir John Yong and to The Christian
and Faithful Reader, dated respectively from Bristol and Henbury. <i>A
Treatise against Idlenes, Idle Pastimes, and Playes.</i> The greater
part deals generally with ‘ydle playes and vaine pastimes’ and their
relation to the Christian life. P. 82. Youth asks Age his opinion
of ‘playes and players, which are commonly vsed and much frequented
in most places in these dayes, especiallye here in this noble and
honourable citie of London’. Age condemns ‘stage playes and enterludes’
as ‘not tollerable, nor sufferable in any common weale, especially
where the Gospell is preached; for it is right prodigalitie, which
is opposite to liberalitie’. Considers ‘the giftes, buildings, and
maintenance of such places for players a spectacle and schoole for
all wickednesse and vice to be learned in’, and particularly applies
this to ‘those places also, whiche are made vppe and builded for such
playes and enterludes, as the Theatre and Curtaine is, and other such
lyke places.... Satan hath not a more speedie way, and fitter schoole
to work and teach his desire, to bring men and women into his snare
of concupiscence and filthie lustes of wicked whoredome, than those
places, and playes, and theatres are; and therefore necessarie that
those places, and players, shoulde be forbidden, and dissolued, and put
downe by authoritie, as the brothell houses and stewes are’. Quotes the
Fathers on the offences to chastity at theatres. P. 92. Condemns the
playing of ‘histories out of the scriptures. By the long suffering and
permitting of these vaine plays, it hath stricken such a blinde zeale
into the heartes of the people, that they shame not to say, and affirme
openly, that playes are as good as sermons, and that they learne as
much or more at a playe, than they do at God’s worde preached.... Many
can tarie at a vayne playe two or three houres, when as they will not
abide scarce one houre at a sermon.... I speake (alas! with griefe
and sorowe of heart) against those people that are so fleshlye ledde,
to see what rewarde there is giuen to such crocodiles, whiche deuoure
the pure chastitie bothe of single and maried persons, men and women,
when as in their playes you shall learne all things that appertayne to
craft, mischiefe, deceytes, and filthinesse, &amp;c. If you will learne
howe to bee false and deceyue your husbandes, or husbandes their wyues,
howe to playe the harlottes, to obtayne one’s loue, howe to rauishe,
howe to beguyle, howe to betraye, to flatter, lye, sweare, forsweare,
how to allure to whoredome,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span> howe to murther, howe to poyson, howe to

to mooue to lustes, to ransacke and spoyle cities and townes, to
bee ydle, to blaspheme, to sing filthie songs of loue, to speake
filthily, to be prowde, howe to mocke, scoffe, and deryde any nation
... shall not you learne, then, at such enterludes howe to practise
them?... Therefore, great reason it is that women (especiallye) shoulde
absent themselues from such playes.’ Notes the <i>infamia</i> of
<i>histriones</i>, which he translates ‘enterlude players’, and refers
to the statute of 1572. Expounds the heathen origin of plays. P. 101.
Youth admits ‘that they ought to be ouerthrowne and put downe.... Yet
I see little sayd, and lesse done vnto them; great resort there is
daily vnto them, and thereout sucke they no small aduantage’. P. 102.
‘They vse to set vp their billes vpon postes certain dayes before, to
admonishe the people to make their resort vnto their theatres, that
they may thereby be the better furnished, and the people prepared to
fill their purses with their treasures.’ P. 102. Youth concludes: ‘I
maruaile the magistrates suffer them thus to continue, and to haue
houses builded for such exercises.... I maruaile much, sithe the rulers
are not onely negligent and slowe herein to doe, but the preachers are
as dumme to speake and saye in a pulpitte against it’; and Age: ‘I
doubt not but God will so moue the hearts of magistrates, and loose
the tongue of the preachers in such godly sort (by the good deuout
prayers of the faithfull) that both with the sworde and the worde such
vnfruitfull and barren trees shall be cut downe’. P. 103. Youth then
raises the question of scholastic plays. These Age admits. ‘I thinke
it is lawefull for a schoolmaster to practise his schollers to playe
comedies, obseruing these and the like cautions: first, that those
comedies which they shall play be not mixt with anye ribaudrie and
filthie termes and wordes (which corrupt good manners). Secondly, that
it be for learning and vtterance sake, in Latine, and very seldome
in Englishe. Thirdly, that they vse not to play commonly and often,
but verye rare and seldome. Fourthlye, that they be not pranked and
decked vp in gorgious and sumptious apparell in their play. Fiftly,
that it be not made a common exercise, publickly, for profit and gaine
of money, but for learning and exercise sake. And lastly, that their
comedies be not mixte with vaine and wanton toyes of loue. These being
obserued, I iudge it tollerable for schollers.’ <i>An Inuectiue against

<p>P. 23. ‘Wyll not a fylthye playe, wyth the blast of a Trumpette, sooner
call thyther a thousande, than an houres tolling of a Bell, bring to
the Sermon a hundred? nay euen heere in the Citie, without it be at

the Curtayne, and other places of Playes in the Citie, you shall on the
Lords day haue these places, with many other that I can not recken, so
full, as possible they can throng.’ P. 50. ‘We notwithstanding on the
Lordes daye must haue Fayers kept, must haue Beare bayting, Bulbayting
(as if it wer a thing of necessity for the Beares of Paris garden to be
bayted on the Sunnedaye) must haue baudie Enterludes.’ P. 85. Calls on
the Mayor, Sheriffs and Aldermen as ‘publike magistrates’ to keep watch
against ‘flocking and thronging to baudie playes by thousandes’ on the
Lord’s Day, and notes ‘resorting to playes in the time of sermons a
thing too manifest’. P. 133. ‘There be not many places where y<sup>e</sup> word
is preached besides the Lords day (I woulde to God there were) yet euen
that day the better parte of it is horriblie prophaned by diuellishe
inuentions, as with Lords of Misserule, Morice dauncers, May-games,
insomuch that in some places, they shame not in y<sup>e</sup> time of diuine
seruice, to come and daunce aboute the Church, and without to haue
men naked dauncing in nettes, which is most filthie: for the heathen
that neuer hadde further knowledge, than the lighte of nature, haue
counted it shamefull for a Player to come on the stage without a slop,
and therefore amongest Christians I hope suche beastly brutishnesse
shal not be let escape vnpunished, for whiche ende I recite it, and
can tell, if I be called, where it was committed within these fewe
weekes. What should I speake of beastlye Playes, againste which out of
this place euery man crieth out? haue we not houses of purpose built
with great charges for the maintenance of them, and that without the
liberties, as who woulde say, there, let them saye what they will say,
we will play. I know not how I might with the godly learned especially
more discommende the gorgeous Playing place erected in the fieldes,
than to terme it, as they please to haue it called, a Theatre ... I
will not here enter this disputation, whether it be vtterly vnlawfull
to haue any playes, but will onelye ioine in this issue, whether in
a Christian common wealth they be tolerable on the Lords day.... If
playing in the Theatre or any other place in London, as there are by
sixe that I know to many, be any of the Lordes wayes (which I suppose
there is none so voide of knowledge in the world wil graunt) then not
only it may, but ought to be vsed, but if it be any of the wayes of
man, it is no work for y<sup>e</sup> Lords Sabaoth, and therfore in no respecte
tollerable on that daye.’ P. 137. ‘For reckening with the leaste, the
gaine that is reaped of eighte ordinarie places in the Citie whiche I
knowe, by playing but once a weeke (whereas many times they play twice
and somtimes thrice) it amounteth to 2000 pounds by the yeare.’</p>

</div>

<p>... I devided the whole history into two Commedies: for that, Decorum
used, it would not be convayde in one. The effects of both, are
good and bad: vertue intermyxt with vice, unlawful desyres (yf it
were possible) queancht with chaste denyals: al needefull action (I
thinke) for publike vewe. For by the rewarde of the good, the good
are encowraged in wel doinge: and with the scowrge of the lewde, the
lewde are feared from evil attempts: mainetayning this my oppinion
with Platoes auctority. ‘Nawghtinesse commes of the corruption of
nature, and not by readinge or hearinge the lives of the good or lewde
(for such publication is necessarye), but goodnesse (sayth he) is
beawtifyed by either action.’ And to these ends Menander Plautus and
Terence, themselves many yeares since intombed, (by their Commedies)
in honour live at this daye. The auncient Romanes heald these showes
of suche prise, that they not onely allowde the publike exercise of
them, but the grave Senators themselves countenaunced the Actors with
their presence: who from these trifles wonne morallyte, as the Bee
suckes the honny from weedes. But the advised devises of auncient
Poets, discredited with the tryfels of yonge, unadvised, and rashe
witted wryters, hath brought this commendable exercise in mislike.
For at this daye, the Italian is so lascivious in his commedies, that
honest hearers are greeved at his actions: the Frenchman and Spaniarde
folowes the Italians humor: the Germaine is too holye: for he presentes
on everye common Stage, what Preachers should pronounce in Pulpets.
The Englishman in this quallitie, is most vaine, indiscreete, and
out of order: he fyrst groundes his worke, on impossibilities: then
in three howers ronnes he throwe the worlde: marryes, gets Children,
makes Children men, men to conquer kingdomes, murder monsters, and
bringeth Gods from Heaven, and fetcheth Divels from Hel. And (that
which is worst) their ground is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span> not so unperfect, as their working
indiscreete: not waying, so the people laugh, though they laugh them
(for theyr folleys) to scorne: Manye tymes (to make mirthe) they
make a Clowne companion with a Kinge: in theyr grave Counsels, they
allow the advise of fooles: yea they use one order of speach for all
persones: a grose <i>Indecorum</i>, for a Crowe wyll yll counterfet the
Nightingales sweete voice: even so, affected Speeche doth misbecome a
Clowne. For to work a Commedie kindly, grave olde men should instruct:
yonge men should showe the imperfections of youth: Strumpets should
be lascivious: Boyes unhappy: and Clownes should be disorderly:
entermingling all these actions, in suche sorte, as the grave matter
may instruct, and the pleasant delight: for without this chaunge,
the attention would be small, and the likinge, lesse. But leave I
this rehearsall, of the use, and abuse of Commedies: least that I
check that in others, which I cannot amend in my selfe. But this I am
assured, what actions so ever passeth in this History, either merry, or
morneful: grave or lascivious; the conclusion showes the confusion of
Vice, and cherishing of Vertue....</p>

<p>[Summary and Extracts.] <i>Epistle to Sidney. Epistle to the
Reader</i>.... ‘I take vpon mee to driue you from playes, when mine
owne woorkes are dayly to be seene vpon stages, as sufficient witnesses
of mine owne folly, and seuere iudges againste my selfe.’ Poetry and
Music are first attacked; an apologist for Homer being likened (p. 21)
‘to some of those players, that come to the scaffold with drum and
trumpet to profer skirmishe, and when they haue sounded allarme, off
go the peeces to encounter a shadow, or conquere a paper monster.’ P.
28. ‘As poetrie and piping are cosen germans: so piping and playing
are of great affinity, and all three chayned in linkes of abuse.’ P.
29. ‘I was first instructed in the university, after drawne like a
nouice to these abuses.’ Criticism of the theatre by the graver Greeks
and Romans and its abuses in Rome. Similar abuses have replaced ‘the
olde discipline of Englande’. P. 35. ‘In our assemblies at playes in
London, you shall see suche heauing, and shoouing, suche ytching and
shouldring, too sitte by the women; suche care for their garments,
that they bee not trode on: such eyes to their lappes, that no chippes
light in them: such pillowes to ther backes, that they take no hurte:
such masking in their eares, I knowe not what: such giuing them pippins
to passe the time: suche playing at foote saunt without cardes: such
ticking, such toying, such smiling, such winking, and such manning
them home, when the sportes are ended, that it is a right comedie, to
marke their behauiour, to watche their conceites, as the catte for the
mouse, and as good as a course at the game it selfe, to dogge them a
little, or followe aloofe by the printe of their feete, and so discouer
by slotte where the deare taketh soyle. If this were as well noted,
as ill seene: or as openly punished, as secretly practised: I haue no
doubte but the cause would be seared to dry vp the effect, and these
prettie rabbets very cunningly ferretted from their borrowes. For
they that lack customers al the weeke, either because their haunte is
vnknowen, or the constables and officers of their parishe watch them
so narrowly, that they dare not queatche, to celebrate the Sabboth,
flock to theaters, and there keepe a generall market of bawdrie: not
that any filthynesse in deede is committed within the compasse of that
grounde, as was doone in Rome, but that euery wanton and his paramour,
euery man and his mistresse, euery John and his Joan, euery knaue and
his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span> queane, are there first acquainted and cheapen the merchandise in
that place, which they pay for elsewhere as they can agree.’ Players
at least indirectly to blame for London’s wantonness. P. 37. ‘They
seeke not to hurte, but desire too please: they haue purged their
comedyes of wanton speaches, yet the corne whiche they sell, is full
of cockle, and the drinke that they drawe, ouercharged with dregges.’
Advises those who would avoid offence to avoid the theatre. The
abuses are contrary to the Queen’s will. P. 39. ‘How often hath her
Maiestie, with the graue aduise of her honorable Councell, sette downe
the limits of apparell to euery degree, and how soone againe hath the
pride of our harts ouerflowen the chanel? How many times hath accesse
to theaters beene restrayned, and how boldly againe haue we reentred.
Ouerlashing in apparel is so common a fault, that the very hyerlings
of some of our players, which stand at reuersion of vi.s by the weeke,
iet vnder gentlemens noses in sutes of silke, exercising themselues
too prating on the stage, and common scoffing when they come abrode,
where they looke askance ouer the shoulder at euery man, of whom the
Sunday before they begged an almes. I speake not this, as though euerye
one that professeth the qualitie so abused him selfe, for it is well
knowen, that some of them are sober, discreete, properly learned honest
housholders and citizens well thought on amonge their neighbours at
home, though the pryde of their shadowes (I meane those hangebyes
whome they succour with stipend) cause them to bee somewhat il talked
of abroade. And as some of the players are farre frome abuse: so some
of their playes are without rebuke: which are as easily remembered as
quickly reckoned. The twooe prose bookes plaied at the Belsauage, where
you shall finde neuer a woorde without wit, neuer a line without pith,
neuer a letter placed in vaine. The <i>Iew</i> and <i>Ptolome</i>,
showne at the Bull, the one representing the greedinesse of worldly
chusers, and bloody mindes of usurers: the other very liuely descrybing
how seditious estates, with their owne deuises, false friendes, with
their owne swoordes, and rebellious commons in their owne snares are
owerthrowne: neither with amorous gesture wounding the eye: nor with
slouenly talke hurting the eares of the chast hearers. The <i>Blacke
Smiths daughter</i>, and <i>Catilins Conspiracies</i> vsually brought
in to the Theater: the first contayning the trechery of Turkes, the
honourable bountye of a noble minde, and the shining of vertue in
distresse: the last, because it is knowen too be a pig of myne owne
sow, I will speake the lesse of it; onely giuing you to vnderstand,
that the whole marke which I shot at in that woorke, was too showe the
rewarde of traytors in Catilin, and the necessary gouernment of learned
men, in the person of Cicero, which forsees euery danger that is likely
to happen, and forstalles it continually ere it take effect.... These
playes are good playes and sweete playes, and of al playes the best
playes and most to be liked, woorthy to bee soung of the Muses, or set
out with the cunning of Roscius himself, yet are they not fit for euery
mans dyet: neither ought they commonly to bee shewen. Now if any man
aske me why my selfe haue penned comedyes in time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span> paste, and inueigh
so egerly against them here, let him knowe that <i>Semel insaniuimus
omnes</i>: I have sinned, and am sorry for my fault: hee runnes farre
that neuer turnes, better late than neuer. I gaue my self to that
exercise in hope to thriue but I burnt one candle to seek another, and
lost bothe my time and my trauell, when I had doone.’ Deprecates the
excuse that plays keep idle heads occupied. P. 42. ‘These because they
are allowed to play euery Sunday, make iiii or v Sundayes at least
euery weeke, and all that is doone is good for Augustus, to busy the
wittes of his people, for running a wool-gathering, and emptie their
purses for thriuing to fast.’ Has shown the abuses of players out of
profane writers rather than out of the Scriptures. Exhorts against
vanity; but, p. 44, ‘if players can promise in woordes, and performe it
in deedes, proclame it in their billes, and make it good in theaters;
that there is nothing there noysome too the body, nor hurtfull to the
soule: and that euerye one which comes to buye their iestes, shall
haue an honest neighbour, tagge and ragge, cutte and longe tayle, goe
thither and spare not, otherwise I aduise you to keepe you thence, my
selfe will beginne too leade the daunce’. Briefly reprehends dancers,
tumblers, dicers, carders, and bowlers, and more at length fencers.
<i>Epistle to Sir Richard Pipe, Lord Mayor, and the Aldermen</i>....
P. 56. ‘I woulde the abuses of my Schoole were as wel knowen of you,
to reformation: as they are found out by other to their owne peril.
But the fishe <i>Sepia</i> can trouble the water to shun the nettes,
that are shot to catch her: <i>Torpedo</i> hath craft inough at the
first touch to inchant the hooke, to coniure the line, to bewitch
the rod, and to benumme the handes of him that angleth. Whether our
players be the spawnes of such fishes, I know not wel, yet I am sure
that how many nets so euer ther be layde to take them, or hookes to
choke them, they haue ynke in their bowels to darken the water, and
sleights in their budgets, to dry vp the arme of euery magistrate. If
their letters of commendations were once stayed, it were easie for you
to ouerthrow them.... I doubte not but the gouernours of London will
vexe mee for speaking my minde, when they are out of their wittes, and
banishe their players, when they are beste aduised.’ <i>Epistle to
the Gentlewomen Citizens of London</i>.... P. 58. ‘It is not ... your
sober countenance, that defendeth your credite; nor your friends which
accompany your person, that excuse your folly; nor your modestie at
home, that couereth your lightnesse, if you present your selues in open
theaters.... Though you go to theaters to se sport, Cupid may catche
you ere you departe.... In deede I muste confesse there comes to playes
of all sortes, old and young; it is hard to say that all offend, yet I
promise you, I wil sweare for none.’</p>

<p>[Summary and Extracts.] P. 3. ‘There came to my hands lately a litle
(would God a wittye) pamphelet, baring a fayre face as though it
were the Scoole of Abuse.’ Defends against Gosson poetry, music, and
thirdly players, for whose art he claims both ‘antiquity’ and ‘use and
comoditye’ as an instrument of moral criticism. P. 24. Of comedies
he says, ‘Tulley defines them thus, <i>Comedia</i> (saith he) is
<i>imitatio vitae, speculum consuetudinis, et imago veritatis</i>’.
P. 27. He has concessions to make. ‘I wish as zealously as the best
that all abuse of playinge weare abolished, but for the thing, the
antiquitie causeth me to allow it, so it be used as it should be. I
cannot allow the prophaning of the Sabaoth. I praise your reprehension
in that; you did well in discommending the abuse, and surely I wysh
that folly wer disclaymed; it is not to be admitted, it maks those
sinne, which perhaps if it were not, would have binne present at a good
sermon. It is in the magistrate to take away that order, and appoynt
it otherwyse. But sure it were pittie to abolish that which hath so
great vertue in it, because it is abused.’ P. 28. He turns on the
critic. ‘But, after your discrediting of playmaking, you salue upon
the sore somewhat, and among many wise workes there be some that fitte
your vaine: The Practice of Parasites is one, which I meruel it likes
you so well, since it bites you so sore. But sure in that I like your
judgement, and for the rest to, I approue your wit, but for the pigg
of your owne sow, (as you terme it) assuredly I must discommend your
verdit: Tell me, Gosson, was all your owne you wrote there? did you
borow nothing of your neyghbours? Out of what booke patched you out
Cicero’s Oration? Whence fet you Catilin’s Inuectiue?.... Beleue me
I should preferr Wilson’s Shorte and sweete if I were judge, a peece
surely worthe prayse, the practice of a good scholler; would the wiser

the <i>Schole of abuse</i>, haue trauailed to some of mine acquaintance
of both Vniuersities, with fayre profers, and greater promises of
rewardes, yf they woulde take so much paine as too write agaynst
mee.... When neither of both Vniuersities would heare their plea, they
were driuen to flie to a weake hedge, and fight for themselues with a
rotten stake.... It is tolde mee that they haue got one in London to
write certaine <i>Honest Excuses</i>, for so they tearme it, to their
dishonest abuses which I reuealed.... How he frames his excuses, I
knowe not yet, because it is doone in hudder mudder. Trueth can neuer
be Falsehods Visarde, which maketh him maske without a torche and keepe
his papers very secret.... If the Excuser be the man that is named
to me, he is as famous a Clarke as <i>Clauitius Sabinus</i>, which
was so troubled with a grosse conceite, and as short a memory, that
euery minute he forgote the names of <i>Vlisses</i>, <i>Achilles</i>,
<i>Priamus</i>, and such as he knew as well as the Begger his dishe....

<p>[From Stationers’ Register, 8 April 1580 (Arber, ii. 368).
This is one of a number of ballads and pamphlets entered in
April-June 1580 as a result of the earthquake on 6 April;
Abraham Fleming, in his <i>A Bright Burning Beacon</i>, names
eight writers on the subject besides himself, including
Thomas Churchyard and Richard Tarlton. It may be that several
of these improved the occasion by reproving bear-baitings
and plays, as did Arthur Golding in his <i>A Discourse Upon
the Earthquake</i>, but it does not appear from Golding’s
‘reporte’ that any playhouses suffered serious damage, although
Halliwell-Phillipps, i. 369, quotes Munday, <i>View of Sundry
Examples</i> (1580), ‘At the playhouses the people came running
foorth, supprised with great astonishment’, and S. Gardiner,
<i>Doomes-day Booke</i> (1606), ‘The earthquake ... shaked not
only the scenicall Theatre, but the great stage and theatre of
the whole land’. On the contrary, the only deaths were those of
two children killed ‘while they were hearing a sermon’ at Christ
Church, Newgate, a detail which is omitted in the reprint of the
‘reporte’ and of some of Golding’s moralizing, with an official
<i>Order of Prayer</i> issued for use in parish churches

P. 99. ‘The first blast in my compt is The Schoole of abuse: a title
not vnfitlie ascribed vnto plaies. For what is there which is not
abused thereby?... that not vnfitlie they are tearmed, as of late The
schoole of abuse, by one; The schoole of Bauderie, by another; The nest
of the Diuel, and sinke of al sinne, by a third’ [<i>in margin</i>,
‘M<sup>r</sup> Spark in his rehersal sermon at Paules Crosse, 29 of April, Ann.

the time present, wherein none, that I knowe, besides these Autors
haue written, though manie, thanked be God, in the principal places of
this land haue, and dailie, yea and openlie do speake against plaies
and Theaters.... Touching the Autor of the latter blast, thou maist
coniecture who he was, but I maie not name him at this time for my
promise sake; yet this do I saie of him, that he hath bine, to vse
his verie wordes, A great affecter of that vaine Art of plaie making,
&amp;c. Yea, which I ad, as excellent an Autor of those vanities, as who
was best.... Praise God, I beseech you, for bringing this Autor, and
Maister Gosson, who made the Schoole of Abuse, out of Babylon.’ <i>A
second blast of retrait.</i> This is translated from Salvian, <i>De
Gubernatione Dei</i>, lib. vi. <i>A third blast of retrait.</i> P. 120.
‘Such doubtles is mine opinion of common plaies, vsual iesting, and
riming extempore that in a Christian-weale they are not sufferable.
My reason is, because they are publike enimies to virtue, &amp; religion:
allurements vnto sinne; corrupters of good manners; the cause of
securitie and carelesnes; meere brothel houses of Bauderie: and bring
both the Gospel into slander; the Sabboth into contempt; mens soules
into danger; and finalie the whole Common-weale into disorder.’
Offers his judgement for what it is worth; describes his experience
of plays and the reasons that led him to turn from them. P. 123. ‘I
confess that ere this I haue bene a great affecter of that vaine art
of Plaie-making, insomuch that I haue thought no time so wel bestowed,
as when my wits were exercised in the inuention of those follies.’ P.
125. ‘What I shal speake of the abuse of plaies by my owne knowledge,
I know maie be affirmed by hundreds, to whom those matters are as wel
knowen as to my selfe. Some citizens wiues, vpon whom the Lord for
ensample to others hath laide his hands, haue euen on their death beds
with teares confessed, that they haue receiued at those spectacles such
filthie infections, as haue turned their minds from chast cogitations,
and made them of honest women light huswiues; by them they haue
dishonored the vessels of holines; and brought their husbandes into
contempt, their children into question, their bodies into sicknes, and
their soules to the state of euerlasting damnation.... When I gaue
my selfe first to note the abuse of common plaies ... the Theater I
found to be an appointed place of Bauderie; mine owne eares haue heard
honest women allured with abhominable speeches. Sometime I haue seen
two knaues at once importunate vpon one light huswife; whereby much
quarel hath growen to the disquieting of manie. There seruants, as it
is manifestlie to be prooued, haue consented to rob their maisters, to
supplie the want of their harlots; there is the practising with married
wiues to traine them from their husbands, and places appointed for
meeting and conference. When I had taken a note of all these abuses,
&amp; sawe that the Theater was become a consultorie house of Satan, I
concluded with my selfe, neuer to imploie my pen to so vile a purpose,
nor to be an instrument of gathering the wicked together.’ Apologizes
for pressing forward in the cause. The abuse of the Sabbath is the
first thing to be put down. P. 128. ‘Let therefore the Magistrate but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
repel them from the libertie of plaieng on the Sabboth daie, For that
is the abuse which is generalie found fault withal, &amp; allowed of none
but those who are altogether destitute of the feare of God, and without
conscience. To plaie on the Sabboth is but a priuiledge of sufferance,
and might with ease be repelled, were it throughlie followed. The
warrant which Magistrats have to forbid plaies is great, and passed
vnto them by such a Prince, whose auctoritie is aboue al auctorities
of earthlie gouernors.... Is not the Sabboth of al other daies the
most abused?... Are not our eies (there) carried awaie with the pride
of vanitie? our eares abused with amorous, that is lecherous, filthie
and abhominable speech? Is not our tong, which was giuen vs onelie to
glorifie God withal, is not our tong there imploied to the blaspheming
of Gods holie Name; or the commendation of that is wicked? Are not our
hartes through the pleasure of the flesh; the delight of the eie; and
the fond motions of the mind, withdrawen from the seruice of the Lord,
&amp; meditation of his goodnes? So that albe it is a shame to saie it, yet
doubtles whosoeuer wil mark with what multitudes those idle places are
replenished, &amp; how emptie the Lordes sanctuarie is of his people, may
wel perceaue what deuotion we haue.... Alas, what folie is in you, to
purchase with a penie damnation to your selues?... The Magistrate is
therefore to prouide in time a remedie to redresse the mischiefes that
are like to ensue by this common plague.... The Magistrates hart must
be as the hart of a Lion. He is not to shrinke in the Lordes cause,
or to stand in feare to reforme abuses of the Common-weale, because
of some particular men of auctoritie.... Alas, that priuate affection
should so raigne in the Nobilitie, that to pleasure, as they thinke,
their seruants, and to vphold them in their vanitie, they should
restraine the Magistrates from executing their office! What credite can
returne to the Noble, to countenance his men to exercise that qualitie
which is not sufferable in anie Common-weale? wheras it was an ancient
custome, that no man of Honor should reteine anie man, but such as
was excellent in some one good qualitie or other, whereby if occasion
so serued, he might get his owne liuing? Then was euerie noble mans
house a Common-weale in it selfe: but since the reteining of these
Caterpillers, the credite of noble men hath decaied, they are thought
to be couetous by permitting their seruants, which cannot liue of them
selues, and whome for neerenes they wil not maintaine, to liue at the
deuotion or almes of other men, passing from countrie to countrie,
from one Gentlemans house to another, offering their seruice, which is
a kind of beggerie. Who in deede, to speake more trulie, are become
beggers for their seruants. For commonlie the goodwil men beare to
their lordes, makes them drawe the stringes of their purses to extend
their liberalitie to them; where otherwise they would not.... Such like
men, vnder the title of their maisters or as reteiners, are priuiledged
to roaue abroad, and permitted to publish their mametree in euerie
Temple of God, and that through England, vnto the horrible contempt of
praier. So that now the Sanctuarie is become a plaiers stage, and a
den of theeues and adulterers.... And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span> trust me I am of that opinion,
that the Lord is neuer so il serued as on the holie-daies. For then
hel breakes loase. Then wee permit our youth to haue their swinge;
and when they are out of the sight of their maisters, such gouernment
haue they of themselues, that what by il companie they meete withal, &amp;
il examples they learne at plaies, I feare me, I feare me their harts
are more alienated in two houres from virtue, than againe maie wel be
amended in a whole yeare.’ P. 135. Players break the first commandment
by profanity. P. 137. Appeal against vanities. ‘Those pleasures of the
stage, what are they, but the drifts of Satan?... The foole no sooner
showeth himselfe in his colors to make men merrie, but straight-waie
lightlie there foloweth some vanitie, not onlie superfluous, but
beastlie and wicked. P. 139. Whosoeuer shal visit the chappel of Satan,
I meane the Theater, shal finde there no want of yong ruffins, nor
lacke of harlots, vtterlie past al shame: who presse to the fore-frunt
of the scaffoldes, to the end to showe their impudencie, and to be as
an obiect to al mens eies. Yea, such is their open shameles behauior,
as euerie man maie perceaue by their wanton gestures, wherevnto they
are giuen; yea, they seeme there to be like brothels of the stewes. For
often without respect of the place and company which behold them, they
commit that filthines openlie, which is horrible to be done in secret;
as if whatsoeuer they did, were warranted. For neither reuerence,
iustice, nor anie thing beside can gouerne them.’ The shamelessness
of young men. ‘Seeke to withdrawe these felowes from the Theater vnto
the sermon, they wil saie, By the preacher they maie be edified, but
by the plaier both edified and delighted.’ P. 142. Plays are a snare
to chastity, both through the examples shown on the stage, and the
comments of companions on the scaffolds. ‘The nature of these Comedies
are, for the most part, after one manner of nature, like the tragical
comedie of Calistus; where the bawdresse Scelestina inflamed the
maiden Melibeia with her sorceries.’ P. 144. Examples of the intrigues
‘aptlie taught in the Schoole of abuse.... I am sorie this schoole is
not pluckt downe by the magistrate; and the schoole-maisters banished
this citie.... The reuerend word of God &amp; histories of the Bible, set
forth on the stage by these blasphemous plaiers, are so corrupted with
their gestures of scurrilitie, and so interlaced with vncleane, and
whorish speeches, that it is not possible to drawe anie profite out
of the doctrine of their spiritual moralities.’ P. 145. Attacks the
authors of plays. ‘The notablest lier is become the best Poet.... Our
nature is led awaie with vanitie, which the auctor perceauing frames
himself with nouelties and strange trifles to content the vaine humors
of his rude auditors, faining countries neuer heard of; monsters
and prodigious creatures that are not; as of the Arimaspie, of the
Grips, the Pigmeies, the Cranes, &amp; other such notorious lies. And if
they write of histories that are knowen, as the life of Pompeie; the
martial affaires of Caesar, and other worthies, they giue them a newe
face, and turne them out like counterfeites to showe themselues on
the stage.... What doe they leaue behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span> them? monumentes of wanton
wicked life, and doting things for men of these latter daies.... But
some perhaps wil saie, The noble man delighteth in such things, whose
humors must be contented, partlie for feare, &amp; partlie for commoditie:
and if they write matters pleasant, they are best preferred in court
among the cunning heads.... Those goodlie persons, if they be voide of
virtue, maie wel be counted like faire clothes ouer a foule wal; big
bladers ful of wind, yet of no waight.’ P. 147. Attacks the actors.
‘When I see by them yong boies, inclining of themselues vnto wickednes,
trained vp in filthie speeches, vnnatural and vnseemlie gestures, to
be brought vp by these Schoole-masters in bawderie, and in idlenes,
I cannot chuse but with teares and griefe of hart lament.... And as
for those stagers themselues, are they not commonlie such kind of
men in their conuersation, as they are in profession? Are they not
as variable in hart, as they are in their partes? Are they not as
good practisers of Bawderie, as inactors? Liue they not in such sort
themselues, as they giue precepts vnto others? doth not their talke
on the stage declare the nature of their disposition?’ Meets divers
objections. P. 148. ‘But they perhaps wil saie, that such abuses as are
handled on the stage, others by their examples, are warned to beware
of such euils, to amendment.... I cannot by anie means beleeue that
the wordes proceeding from a prophane plaier, and vttered in scorning
sort, interlaced with filthie, lewde, &amp; vngodlie speeches, haue greater
force to mooue men vnto virtue, than the wordes of truth vttered
by the godlie Preacher.... If the good life of a man be a better
instruction to repentance than the tong, or words, why do not plaiers,
I beseech you, leaue examples of goodnes to their posteritie?... Are
they not notoriouslie knowen to be those men in their life abroade,
as they are on the stage, roisters, brallers, il-dealers, bosters,
louers, loiterers, ruffins?... To conclude, the principal end of all
their interludes is to feede the world with sights, &amp; fond pastimes;
to iuggle in good earnest the monie out of other mens purses into
their owne handes.’ P. 150. ‘Some haue obiected, that by these
publique places manie forbeare to do euil for feare to be publiquelie
reprehended. And for that cause they wil saie it was tolerated in Rome,
wherein Emperors were touched, though they were present. But to such
it maie be answered, first that in disguised plaiers giuen ouer to al
sortes of dissolutenes, is not found so much as a wil to do good, seing
they care for nothing lesse than for virtue. Secondlie, that is not a
good meanes to correct sinne. For that if it be secret, it ought not
to be reuealed openlie, but by such meanes to be reformed as Christ
himselfe alloweth in his Gospel.’ P. 151. ‘The antiquitie of plaieng
is likewise often vsed for an argument to proue it allowable. But the
custome of euil is not to be maintained, because of antiquitie.’ P.
152. A final appeal. ‘The citie Marsiles ... would receaue into it
no stage-plaiers.... I would to God the Magistrates of our citie of
London would haue the like foresight. The permission of plaies so long
a time hath alreadie corrupted this citie; and brought the name of
the citizens into slander; the examples of Gods iudgement is at this
present an example in this citie.’</p>

<p>[Summary and Extracts.] <i>Epistle to Sir Frances Walsingham.</i> ‘So
fareth it this present time with me, which giuing forth my Defiaunce
vnto Playes, am mightily beset with heapes of aduersaries.... I thought
it necessarye to nettle one of their Orators aboue the rest, not of
any set purpose to deface hym, because hee hath dealt very grossely,
homely, and vncharitably with me, but like a good Surgeon to cut, &amp; to
seare, when the place requireth, for his owne amendment. Which thinge
I trust shall neither displease your honor, nor any of the godly, in
the reading, so long as the person whom I touch is (as I heare by hys
owne frendes, to hys repentance if he can perceiue it) hunted by the
heauy hand of God, and become little better than a vagarant, looser
than liberty, lighter than vanitie it selfe.’ Plays are an Augean
stable to be cleansed. ‘If euer so notable a thinge bee brought to
passe it must bee done by some Hercules in the Court, whom the roare of
the enimy can neuer daunt.’ Hints that this should be Walsingham. ‘The
Gentlemen Players in the citie of London, are growen in such a heate,
that by their foming, their fretting, their stampinge, my frendes do
perceiue how their harts woorke, and enforce me to bring to your honor
no common fraighte, but as much as my life and securitie hereafter
shall be woorth. If the prouidence of God, who many times scourgeth a
man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span> with the sinne that he loued, haue ordeined those players whom
I fed with fancies, to be a whippe to my back, and a dagger to my
brest, the fault is mine owne, the punishmente due.’ <i>Epistle to the
Universities and Inns of Court.</i> P. 165. ‘I was very willing to
write at this time, because I was enformed by some of you which heard
it with your ears, that since my publishing the <i>Schole of Abuse</i>,
two Playes of my making were brought to the Stage: the one was a cast
of Italian deuises, called, The Comedie of Captaine Mario: the other
a Moral, Praise at parting. These they very impudently affirme to be
written by me since I had set out my inuectiue against them. I can not
denie, they were both mine, but they were both penned two yeeres at
the least before I forsoke them, as by their owne friends I am able
to proue: but they haue got suche a custome of counterfaiting vpon
the Stage, that it is growen to a habite, &amp; will not be lefte. God
knoweth, before whom to you all I doe protest, as I shall answer to
him at the last day, when al hidden secrets shal be discouered, since
the first printing of my Inuectiue, to this day, I neuer made Playe
for them nor any other.... I departed from the City of London, and
bestowed my time in teaching yong Gentlemen in the Countrie, where I
continue with a very worshipfull Gentleman, and reade to his sonnes
in his owne house.... As sonne as I had inueighed against Playes, I
withdrewe my selfe from them to better studies, which so long as I liue
I trust to follow.’ <i>The Confutation of Playes. The First Action.</i>
The Efficient Cause of Plays. Defends his own change of mind. P. 167.
‘When I firste gaue my selfe to the studie of Poetrie, and to set my
cunning abroache, by penning Tragedies and Comedies in the Citte of
London: perceiuing such a Gordians knot of disorder in euery play
house, as woulde neuer bee loosed without extremitie, I thought it
better with Alexander to draw y<sup>e</sup> sword that should knappe it a sunder
at one stroke, than to seeke ouernisely or gingerly to vndoe it, with
the losse of my time and wante of successe. This caused mee to bidde
them the base at their owne gole, and to geue them a volley of heathen
writers: that our diuines considering the danger of suche houses as are
set vp in London against the Lord, might better them thoroughly with
greater shotts.’ An incomplete remedy. ‘Acknowledging the mischiefe
bred by playes wee hope to auoid yt by changing their day yet suffer
them still to remaine amonge vs.... The abhominable practises of playes
in London haue bene by godly preachers, both at Paules crosse, and else
where so zealously, so learnedly, so loudly cried out vpon to small
redresse; that I may well say of them, as the Philosophers reporte of
the moouing of the heauens, we neuer heare them, because we euer heare
them.’ Notes an answer to him. P. 169. ‘Amongest all the fauorers of
these vncircumcised Philistines, I meane the Plaiers, whose heartes are
not right, no man til of late durst thrust out his heade to mayntaine
there quarrell, but one, in witt, simple; in learning, ignorant; in
attempt, rash; in name, Lodge: whose booke, as it came not to my handes
in one whole yeere after the priuy printing thereof, so I confesse,
that to it, before this time, I aunswered nothing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span> partlie because he
brought nothing; partlie because my hearte was to bigge, to wrastle
with him, that wanteth armes. Therefore considering with my selfe
that such kinde of sores might bee launced to sone, I chose rather
to let him ripen and breake of him selfe, that vomiting out his owne
disgrace, &amp; being worne out of fauour among his own friends, I might
triumph in the cause &amp; shedde no blood.... Some of his acquaintance
haue vaunted to cut and hewe mee, I knowe not howe.’ The Devil is the
efficient cause of plays, as noted by Tertullian. P. 171. ‘And William
[‘Thomas’ on a cancel in some copies] Lodge in that patchte pamphlet of
his ... confesseth openly that playes were consecrated by the heathens
to y<sup>e</sup> honour of their gods.’ Expounds the policy of the Devil in the
matter. P. 172. ‘First hee sente ouer many wanton Italian bookes....
Not contented with the number he hath corrupted with reading Italian
baudery, because all cannot reade, [he] presenteth vs Comedies cut by
the same paterne, which drag such a monstrous taile after them, as is
able to sweep whole Cities into his lap.’ Argues that plays are of
idolatrous origin, and disliked by Scipio Nasica and other severer
Romans. Rome held players infamous. P. 178. ‘Wherefore I beseech God so
to touch the heartes of our Magistrates with a perfite hatred of sinne,
and feare of Iudgement; so to stirr vp some noble Scipio in the Courte,
that these daunsing Chaplines of Bacchus and all such as set vp these
wicked artes, may be driuen out of Englande.’ <i>The Second Action.</i>
The Material Cause of Plays. P. 179. ‘Yonge Master Lodge thinking to
iett vpon startoppes, and steale an ynche of his hight by the bare name
of Cicero, allegeth from him, y<sup>t</sup> a Play is the Schoolmistresse of
life; the lookinge glasse of manners; and the image of trueth.... It
seemeth that Master Lodge saw this in Tullie with other folkes eyes,
and not his owne. For to my remembrance I neuer read it in him, neither
doe I thinke that Master Lodge can shewe it me.’ Cites passages of
Cicero against <i>spectacula</i>. Sets down the matter of plays. P.
180. ‘The argument of Tragedies is wrath, crueltie, incest, iniurie,
murther eyther violent by sworde, or voluntary by poyson. The persons,
Gods, Goddesses, furies, fiendes, Kinges, Quenes, and mightie men. The
grounde worke of Commedies, is loue, cosenedge, flatterie, bawderie,
slye conueighance of whoredome; The persons, cookes, queanes, knaues,
baudes, parasites, courtezannes, lecherous olde men, amorous yong men.’
Criticizes the Lodge-Cicero metaphor in detail. Plays no schoolmistress
of life. ‘The beholding of troubles and miserable slaughters that are
in Tragedies, driue vs to immoderate sorrow, heauines, womanish weeping
and mourning, whereby we become louers of dumpes, and lamentation, both
enemies to fortitude. Comedies so tickle our senses with a pleasanter
vaine, that they make vs louers of laughter, and pleasure, without any
meane, both foes to temperance. What schooling is this? Sometime you
shall see nothing but the aduentures of an amorous knight, passing
from countrie to countrie for the loue of his lady, encountring many
a terible monster made of broune paper, &amp; at his retorne, is so
wonderfully changed, that he can not be knowne but by some posie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span> in
his tablet, or by a broken ring, or a handkircher, or a piece of a
cockle shell. What learne you by that? When y<sup>e</sup> soule of your playes
is eyther meere trifles, or Italian baudery, or wooing of gentlewomen,
what are we taught?’ Aristotle forbade plays to the young. P. 182. ‘If
any goodnes were to be learned at Playes it is likely that the Players
them selues which committ euery sillable to memory shoulde profitte
most ... but the dayly experience of their behauiour sheweth, that they
reape no profit by the discipline them selues.’ Thinks Master Lodge
found ‘some peeuish index or gatherer of Tullie to be a sleepe....
Wherein I perceiue hee is no changeling, for he disputeth as soundly
being from the vniuersitie and out of exercise, as he did when hee was
there, and at his booke.’ P. 183. Plays no glass of behaviour. Manners
should not be rebuked where no reply is possible, or before such judges
as ‘the common people which resorte to Theaters being but an assemblie
of Tailers, Tinkers, Cordwayners, Saylers, olde Men, yong Men, Women,
Boyes, Girles, and such like’. The Roman law of libel restrained
‘the ouer-lashing of players’. P. 185. Criticizes [Wilson’s] <i>The
Three Ladies of London</i> [cf. ch. xxiii] for making Love detest and
Conscience allow plays; also a rival play of <i>London against the
Three Ladies</i>. Denies that intention either of poets or players is
to profit those they rebuke. P. 187. Plays not the image of truth. P.
188. ‘In Playes either those thinges are fained that neuer were, as
Cupid and Psyche plaid at Paules; and a greate many Comedies more at ye
Blacke friers and in euery Playe house in London, which for breuities
sake I ouer skippe: of if a true Historie be taken in hand, it is made
like our shadows, longest at the rising and falling of the Sunne,
shortest of all at hie noone. For the Poets driue it most commonly vnto
such pointes as may best showe the maiestie of their pen in Tragicall
speaches; or set the hearers a gogge with discourses of loue; or painte
a fewe antickes to fitt their owne humors with scoffes &amp; tauntes; or
wring in a shewe to furnish the Stage when it is to bare; when the
matter of it selfe comes shorte of this, they followe the practise of
the cobler, and set their teeth to the leather to pull it out. So was
the history of Caesar and Pompey, and the Playe of the Fabii at the
Theater, both amplified there, where the Drummes might walke, or the
pen ruffle; when the history swelled and ran to hye for the number of
y<sup>e</sup> persons that should playe it, the Poet with Proteus [? Procrustes]
cut the same fit to his owne measure; when it afoorded no pompe at al,
he brought it to the racke to make it serue.... I may boldely say it
because I haue seene it, that the Palace of pleasure, the Golden Asse,
the Œthiopian historie, Amadis of Fraunce, the Rounde Table, baudie
Comedies in Latine, French, Italian, and Spanish, haue beene throughly
ransackt to furnish the Playe houses in London.... Forsooth saith
the Authour of the Playe of plays showen at the Theater, the three
and twentieth of Februarie last: They shalbe nowe purged, the matter
shalbe good.... As for that glosing plaie at y<sup>e</sup> Theater which profers
you so faire, there is enterlaced in it a baudie song of a maide of
Kent, and a little beastly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span> speech of the new stawled roge, both which
I am compelled to burie in silence, being more ashamed to vtter them
than they.’ Thinks the minority of honest plays a trick of the devil.
Repeats his points as to the idolatrous origin of plays and the infamy
of players at Rome. The devil makes them alluring. P. 192. ‘For the
eye, beeside the beautie of the houses and the Stages, hee sendeth
in Gearish apparell, maskes, vauting, tumbling, daunsing of gigges,
galiardes, morisces, hobbihorses, showing of iudgeling castes.’ <i>The
Third Action.</i> The Formal Cause of Plays. P. 195. ‘The Law of God
very straightly forbids men to put on womens garments.’ This is not to
be explained away as a prohibition of disguises meant to facilitate
adultery, but is absolute. P. 197. ‘In Stage Playes for a boy to put
one the attyre, the gesture, the passions of a woman; for a meane
person to take vpon him the title of a Prince with counterfeit porte,
and traine, is by outwarde signes to shewe them selues otherwise then
they are, and so with in the compasse of a lye, which by Aristotles
iudgement is naught of it selfe and to be fledde.’ Admits that Gregory
Nazianzen and Buchanan wrote plays. ‘To what ende? To be Plaied vpon
Stages? neither Players nor their friendes are able to proue it.’
Refutes another objection. P. 198. ‘Let the Author of the playe of
playes &amp; pastimes, take heede how he reason y<sup>t</sup> action, pronuntiation,
agility of body are y<sup>e</sup> good gifts of God. <i>Ergo</i>, plaies
consisting of these cannot be euill.’ Even the heathens condemned the
waste of money in spectacles. <i>The Fourth Action.</i> The Final Cause
of Plays. P. 201. The end of plays is sinful delight, as is proved
by the admissions of Menander and Terence, ‘By the manner of penning
in these dayes, because the Poets send theire verses to the Stage
vpon such feete as continually are rowled vp in rime at the fingers
endes, which is plaucible to the barbarous, and carrieth a stinge into
the eares of the common people. By the obiect, because Tragedies and
Commedies stirre vp affections, and affections are naturally planted
in that part of the minde that is common to vs with brute beastes.’
Analyses the argument of the Author of the Play of Plays, ‘spreading
out his battel to hemme me in’. P. 202. ‘He tyeth Life and Delight so
fast together, that if Delight be restrained, Life presently perisheth;
there, zeale perceyuing Delight to be embraced of Life, puttes a snafle
in his mouth, to keepe him vnder. Delight beinge bridled, Zeale leadeth
life through a wildernesse of lothsomenesse, where Glutte scarreth them
all, chafing both Zeale and Delight from Life, and with the clubbe
of amasednesse strikes such a pegge into the heade of Life, that he
falles downe for dead vpon the Stage. Life beinge thus fainte, and
ouertrauailed, destitute of his guyde, robbed of Delight, is readie to
giue vp the Ghost, in the same place; then entereth Recreation, which
with music and singing rockes Life a sleepe to recouer his strength.
By this meanes Tediousnesse is driuen from Life, and the teinte is
drawne out of his heade, which the club of amasednes left behinde. At
last Recreation setteth vp the Gentleman vpon his feete, Delight is
restored to him againe, and such kinde of sportes for cullices are
brought in to nourishe him, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span> none but Delighte must applye to his
stomache. Then time beinge made for the benefite of Life, and Life
being allowed to followe his appetite, amongst all manner of pastimes,
Life chooseth Commedies, for his Delight, partly because Commedies are
neither chargable to y<sup>e</sup> beholders purse, nor painful to his body;
partly, because he may sit out of the raine to veiwe the same, when
many other pastimes are hindred by wether. Zeale is no more admitted to
Life before he be somewhat pinchte in the waste, to auoyde extremitie,
and being not in the end simply called Zeale but Moderate Zeale a fewe
conditions are prescribed to Comedies, that the matter be purged,
deformities blazed, sinne rebuked, honest mirth intermingled, and fitte
time for the hearing of the same appointed. Moderate Zeale is contented
to suffer them, who wyneth with delight to direct life againe, after
which he triumphes ouer Death &amp; is crowned with eternitie.’ P. 203.
As Fathers and Councils ‘and y<sup>e</sup> skilfulst Deuines at this day in
England which are compelled in Sermons to cry out against them’ are
challenged by this playmaker, will answer him. Distinguishes between
carnal and spiritual delight. Plays bring carnal delight, which is
contrary to reason and comes of corruption. <i>The Fifth Action.</i>
The Effects of Plays. P. 211. Why should he write against plays, when,
although famous men in both universities cry out against plays, ‘none
of them by printing haue taken the paines to write any full discouery
against them’? Partly because, being young, he will be better excused
than they if he ‘shoulde speake but one worde against y<sup>e</sup> sleepines
of Magistrats which in this case is necessary to be toucht’; partly
because, ‘hauing once already written against playes, which no man
that euer wrote playes, did, but one, who hath changed his coppy,
and turned himself like y<sup>e</sup> dog to his vomite, to plays againe, and
being falsly accused my selfe to do y<sup>e</sup> like, it is needfull for me
to write againe’. Declares the effects of plays. Wantonness on the
stage excites the passions of the spectators. Theatres are ‘markets
of bawdry’. P. 215. ‘Our Theaters, and play houses in London, are as
full of secrete adulterie as they were in Rome.... In the playhouses
at London, it is the fashion of youthes to go first into the yarde,
and to carry theire eye through euery gallery, then like vnto rauens
where they spye the carion thither they flye, and presse as nere to y<sup>e</sup>
fairest as they can.... They giue them pippines, they dally with their
garmentes to passe y<sup>e</sup> time, they minister talke vpon al occasions,
&amp; eyther bring them home to their houses on small acquaintance, or
slip into tauerns when y<sup>e</sup> plaies are done. He thinketh best of his
painted sheath, &amp; taketh himselfe for a iolly fellow, y<sup>t</sup> is noted of
most, to be busyest with women in all such places.’ The players are
an evil in the commonwealth. P. 215. ‘Most of the Players haue bene
eyther men of occupations, which they haue forsaken to lyue by playing,
or common minstrels, or trayned vp from theire childehood to this
abhominable exercise &amp; haue now no other way to get theire liuinge....
In a commonweale, if priuat men be suffered to forsake theire calling
because they desire to walke gentleman like in sattine &amp; veluet, with
a buckler at their heeles, proportion is so broken, vnitie dissolued,
harmony confounded,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span> that the whole body must be dismembred and the
prince or the heade cannot chuse but sicken.... Let them not looke to
liue by playes; the little thrift that followeth theire greate gaine,
is a manifest token that God hath cursed it.’ A final appeal to his
countrymen, ending, ‘God is iust, his bow is bent &amp; his arrowe drawen,
to send you a plague, if you staye too long’.</p>

<p>Epistle to the Lord Mayor, William Fleetwood, the Recorder, and the
Aldermen. Explains the address to them. A 2<sup>v</sup>. ‘Is it not a lamentable
thing, that after so long preaching of the Gospell, there should bee
so great prophanation amongst vs? that Theaters should be full and
churches be emptie? that the streetes shoulde be replenished, and the
places of holy exercises, left destitute? I write not this simplie but
in respect, and by comparison.... If you say that this thing belongeth
not vnto you, because that Parris garden is out of your iurisdiction,
yet why are these men suffered to bring their Beares into the citie,
that thereby they may gather your company vnto them? It were duety in
you to hinder these and to take order that none of the citie should
repaire vnto such places.... 18<sup>th</sup> January 1583. Iohn Feild.’
The exhortation is mainly a general call to repentance and fear of
judgement, without special reference to the occasion. B 3. Stress is laid on abuse of the Sabbath. B 4.
‘There is no Dicing house, Bowling alley, Cock pit, or Theater, that
can be found empty. Those flagges of defiance against God, &amp; trumpets
that are blown to gather together such company, will sooner preuail to
fil those places, then the preaching of the holy worde of God ... to
fill Churches. Nothing can stoppe them from the same: neyther feare of
danger, losse of tyme, corruption of maners, infection of diseases,
expence of money, suspition of honestie and such like.... Pounds
and hundreds can be well ynough afforded, in following these least
pleasures, though euery dore hath a payment, &amp; euery gallerie maketh
a yearely stipend: thogh euery dog hath a coller, &amp; euery Beare a
prize, and euery cracke bring a great aduenture.’ Enforces the warning
of Paris Garden. B vii<sup>v</sup>. ‘I wil set it down as plainly as I can, and
as truly as can be gathered from the examination of those same common
euidences, that haue fallen out.... You shal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span> vnderstand therfore
(beloued Christians) that vpon the last Lords day being the thirteen
day of the first month, that cruell and lothsome exercise of bayting
Beares being kept at <i>Parris-garden</i>, in the after-noone, in the
time of common praiers, and when many other exercises of Religion, both
of preaching and Catechizing were had in sundry places of the City,
diuers Preachers hauing not long before also cryed out against such
prophanations: yet (the more pitty) there resorted thither a great
company of people of al sorts and conditions, that the like nomber,
in euery respect (as they say) had not beene seene there a long time
before. Beeing thus vngodly assembled, to so vnholy a spectacle and
specially considering the time; the yeard, standings, and Galleries
being ful fraught, being now amidest their iolity, when the dogs and
Bear were in the chiefest Battel, Lo the mighty hand of God vppon them.
This gallery that was double, and compassed the yeard round about, was
so shaken at the foundation, that it fell (as it were in a moment) flat
to the ground, without post or peere, that was left standing, so high
as the stake whervnto the Beare was tied. Although some wil say (and as
it may be truly) that it was very old and rotten and therefore a great
waight of people, being planted vpon it then was wont, that it was no
maruaile that it fayled: and would make it but a light matter. Yet
surely if this be considered, that no peece of post, boord, or stake
was left standing: though we vrge it not as a miracle, yet it must
needes be considered as an extraordinary iudgement of God, both for
the punishment of those present prophaners of the Lordes day that were
then, &amp; also informe and warne vs that were abroad. In the fal of it,
there were slaine fiue men and two women, that are come to knowledge,
who they were and where they dwelled, to wit, <i>Adam Spencer</i>
a <i>Felmonger</i>, in <i>Southwarke</i>, <i>William Cockram</i> a
Baker, dwelling in <i>Shordich</i>, <i>Iohn Burton</i> Cleark, of
<i>S. Marie Wolmers</i> in <i>Lombard streat</i>, <i>Mathew Mason</i>,
seruant with Master <i>Garland</i>, dwelling in <i>Southwarke</i>,
<i>Thomas Peace</i>, seruant with <i>Robert Tasker</i>, dwelling in
<i>Clerken well</i>. The maydens names, <i>Alice White</i>, seruant to
a Pursemaker without <i>Cripplegate</i>, and <i>Marie Harrison</i>,
daughter to <i>Iohn Harrison</i>, being a waterbearer, dwelling in
<i>Lombard streat</i>.’ C i<sup>v</sup>. Nowe beside these that were thus
killed out right, with the flat fal of the Galleries, strangely
wrunge in peeces as it were by God himselfe, it could not bee but in
such confusion, there must needes come great hurt to many. Howe many
carried away death, as it were in theyr bosomes, that died the same
night, or some little tyme after, the Lorde knoweth. And we heare
since, though we know not the iust number, that many of them are dead
&amp; buried, and namely one <i>Web</i> a Pewterer his wife that dwelt
in <i>Limestreete</i> who being there sore wounded, is now gon with
diuers others. Of all the multitude there, which must needes be farre
aboue a thousande, it is thought by the iudgement of most people, that
not the third personne escaped vnhurt; and by some that haue made
search, they esteme that there were sore hurt and maimed, aboue one
hundred and fiftye persons, some hauing theyr legs and armes broken,
some theyr backes, theyr bodies beeing sore brused, so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span> euery
way into the cittie from that time tyll towardes nine of the clocke
and past: and specially ouer <i>London bridge</i>, many were carried
in Chayres, &amp; led betwixt their freendes, and so brought home wyth
sorrowfull and heauy heartes lyke lame cripples. They say also that
at the first, when the Scaffolde cracked (as it did once or twise)
there was a crye of <i>fire fire</i>, which set them in such a maze as
was wonderfull, so that as destitute of their wits they stood styll,
and could make no shifte for them selues, till the Scaffold was made
euen with the ground.... Amongst the rest it is credibly reported
that there was one Woman, that beeing in the Gallery, threw downe her
childe before her, &amp; leaped after herselfe; and yet thankes bee to God
neyther of both had any maner of hurt, so was it with diuers others.
But it shoulde appere that they were most hurt and in danger, which
stoode vnder the Galleries on the grounde, vpon whom both the waight
of Timbre and people fel. And sure it was a miraculous worke of God,
that any one of those should haue escaped. But heere also God shewed
his power for one man falling downe into an hole as if it had beene
some sawpit, it pleased God that it was the meane of his deliuerance,
so as all things that fell vpon him did not touch him, and by that hee
was preserued, wheras two of th’other were slaine of either side of
him.’ C. iii. Urges the magistrates to ‘take order especially on the
Sabaoth dayes that no Cittizen or Cittizens seruauntes haue libertie
to repaire vnto any of those abuse places, that albeit the place be
without the Cittie, and by that meanes they haue not to deale with
them, yet that they keepe theyr <i>Beares</i> out, and their straggling
<i>Wantons</i> in, that they may be better occupied. And as they haue
with good commendation so far preuailed, that vppon Sabaoth dayes
these Heathenishe <i>Enterludes</i> and <i>Playes</i> are banished,
so it wyll please them to followe the matter still, that they may be
vtterly rid and taken away. For surely it is to be feared, beesides the
distruction bothe of bodye and soule, that many are brought vnto, by
frequenting the <i>Theater</i>, the <i>Curtin</i> and such like, that
one day those places will likewise be cast downe by God himselfe, &amp;
being drawen with them a huge heape of such contempners and prophane
persons vtterly to be killed and spoyled in their bodyes. God hath
giuen them as I haue heard manye faire warninges already.... January
17, 1583.’</p>

<p>[Summary and Extracts.] The book, which is ‘made dialogue-wise’
between Spudeus and Philoponus, who does most of the denunciation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
is not confined to the stage, but is a comprehensive analysis of
contemporary frailty. <i>Epistle to Phillip Earl of Arundel. Preface
to the Reader.</i> P. x. ‘Wheras in the processe of this my booke,
I haue intreated of certen exercyses vsually practised amongest vs,
as namely of Playes and Enterludes.... I would not haue thee so to
take mee, as though my speaches tended to the overthrowe and vtter
disliking of all kynd of exercyses in generall: that is nothing my
simple meaning. But the particulare Abuses which are crept into euery
one of these seuerall exercyses is the only thing which I think worthie
of reprobation. For otherwise (all Abuses cut away) who seeth not that
some kind of playes, tragedies and enterluds, in their own nature are
not only of great ancientie, but also very honest and very commendable
exercyses, being vsed and practised in most Christian common weales, as
which containe matter (such they may be) both of doctrine, erudition,
good example, and wholsome instruction; and may be vsed, in tyme and
place conuenient, as conducible to example of life and reformation of
maners. For such is our grosse and dull nature, that what thing we see
opposite before our eyes, do pearce further and printe deeper in our
harts and minds, than that thing which is hard onely with the eares....
But being vsed (as now commonly they be) to the prophanation of the
Lord his sabaoth, to the alluring and inuegling of the People from
the blessed word of God preached, to Theaters and vnclean assemblies,
to ydlenes, vnthriftynes, whordome, wantonnes, drunkennes, and what
not; and which is more, when they are vsed to this end, to maintaine
a great sort of ydle Persons, doing nothing but playing and loytring,
hauing their lyuings of the sweat of other Mens browes, much like vnto
dronets deuouring the sweet honie of the poore labouring bees, than
are they exercyses (at no hand) sufferable. But being vsed to the ends
that I haue said, they are not to be disliked of any sober and wise
Christian.’ <i>The Maner of Sanctifiyng the Sabaoth in Ailgna.</i> P.
137. ‘Some spend the Sabaoth day (for the most part) in frequenting of
baudie Stage-playes and enterludes.’ P. 140. <i>Of Stage-playes and
Enterluds, with their wickednes.</i> ‘All Stage-playes, Enterluds, and
Commedies are either of diuyne or prophane matter: If they be of diuine
matter, then are they most intollerable, or rather Sacrilegious; for
that the blessed word of God is to be handled reuerently, grauely,
and sagely, with veneration to the glorious Maiestie of God, which
shineth therin, and not scoffingly, flowtingly, and iybingly, as
it is vpon stages in Playes and Enterluds, without any reuerence,
worship, or veneration to the same. The word of our Saluation, the
price of Christ his bloud, &amp; the merits of his passion, were not
giuen to be derided and iested at, as they be in these filthie playes
and enterluds on stages &amp; scaffolds, or to be mixt and interlaced
with bawdry, wanton shewes, &amp; vncomely gestures, as is vsed (euery
Man knoweth) in these playes and enterludes.... Doo these Mockers
and Flowters of his Maiesty, these dissembling <i>Hipocrites</i>,
and flattering <i>Gnatoes</i>, think to escape vnpunished? beware,
therfore, you masking Players, you painted sepulchres, you doble
dealing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span> ambodexters, be warned betymes, and, lik good computistes,
cast your accompts before, what wil be the reward therof in the end,
least God destroy you in his wrath: abuse God no more, corrupt his
people no longer with your dregges, and intermingle not his blessed
word with such prophane vanities. For at no hand it is not lawfull to
mixt scurrilitie with diuinitie, nor diuinitie with scurrilitie....
Vpon the other side, if their playes be of prophane matters, than tend
they to the dishonor of God, and norishing of vice, both which are
damnable. So that whither they be the one or the other, they are quite
contrarie to the Word of grace, and sucked out of the Deuills teates
to nourish vs in ydolatrie, hethenrie, and sinne. And therfore they,
cariyng the note, or brand, of God his curse vppon their backs, which
way soeuer they goe, are to be hissed out of all Christian kingdomes,
if they wil haue Christ to dwell amongst them.’ Quotes the Fathers and
ancients against <i>histriones</i>. P. 143. ‘Then, seeing that Playes
were first inuented by the Deuil, practised by the heathen gentiles,
and dedicat to their false ydols, Goddes and Goddesses, as the howse,
stage, and apparell to <i>Venus</i>, the musicke to <i>Appollo</i>, the
penning to <i>Minerua</i> and the Muses, the action and pronuntiation
to <i>Mercurie</i> and the rest, it is more than manifest that they
are no fit exercyses for a Christen Man to follow. But if there were
no euill in them saue this, namely, that the arguments of tragedies is
anger, wrath, immunitie, crueltie, iniurie, incest, murther, &amp; such
like, the Persons or Actors are Goddes, Goddesses, Furies, Fyends,
Hagges, Kings, Queenes, or Potentates. Of Commedies the matter and
ground is loue, bawdrie, cosenage, flattery, whordome, adulterie;
the Persons, or agents, whores, queanes, bawdes, scullions, knaues,
Curtezans, lecherous old men, amorous yong men, with such like of
infinit varietie. If, I say, there were nothing els but this, it were
sufficient to withdraw a good christian from the vsing of them; For so
often as they goe to those howses where Players frequent, thei go to
<i>Venus</i> pallace, &amp; sathans synagogue [<i>in margin</i>, ‘Theaters
and curtaines Venus pallaces’], to worship deuils, &amp; betray Christ
Iesus.’ To say that plays are ‘as good as sermons’ is to say that ‘the
Deuill is equipolent with the Lord’. P. 144. ‘There is no mischief
which these plaies maintain not. For do they not norish ydlenes? and
<i>otia dant vitia</i>, ydlenes is the Mother of vice. Doo they not
draw the people from hering the word of God, from godly Lectures and
sermons? for you shall haue them flocke thither, thick &amp; threefould,
when the church of God shalbe bare &amp; emptie.... Do they not maintaine
bawdrie, infinit folery, &amp; renue the remembrance of hethen ydolatrie?
Do they not induce whordom &amp; vnclennes? nay, are they not rather plaine
deuourers of maydenly virginitie and chastitie? For proofe wherof,
but marke the flocking and running to Theaters &amp; curtens, daylie and
hourely, night and daye, tyme and tyde, to see Playes and Enterludes;
where such wanton gestures, such bawdie speaches, such laughing and
fleering, such kissing and bussing, such clipping and culling, Suche
winckinge and glancinge of wanton eyes, and the like, is vsed, as
is wonderfull to behold. Then, these goodly pageants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span> being done,
euery mate sorts to his mate, euery one bringes another homeward of
their way verye freendly, and in their secret conclaues (couertly)
they play the <i>Sodomits</i>, or worse. And these be the fruits of
Playes or Enterluds for the most part. And wheras you say there are
good Examples to be learned in them, Trulie so there are: if you will
learne falshood; if you will learn cosenage; if you will learn to
deceiue; if you will learn to play the Hipocrit, to cogge, lye, and
falsifie; if you will learne to iest, laugh, and fleer, to grin, to
nodd, and mow; if you will learn to playe the vice, to swear, teare,
and blaspheme both Heauen and Earth: If you will learn to become a
bawde, vncleane, and to deuerginat Maydes, to deflour honest Wyues:
if you will learne to murther, slaie, kill, picke, steal, robbe, and
roue: If you will learn to rebel against Princes, to commit treasons,
to consume treasurs, to practise ydlenes, to sing and talke of bawdie
loue and venery; if you will lerne to deride, scoffe, mock, &amp; flowt,
to flatter &amp; smooth: If you will learn to play the whore-maister,
the glutton, Drunkard, or incestuous person: if you will learn to
become proude, hawtie, &amp; arrogant; and, finally, if you will learne
to contemne God and al his lawes, to care nither for heauen nor hel,
and to commit al kinde of sinne and mischeef, you need to goe to no
other schoole, for all these good Examples may you see painted before
your eyes in enterludes and playes: wherfore that man who giueth
money for the maintenance of them must needs incurre the damage of
<i>premunire</i>, that is, eternall damnation, except they repent.
For the Apostle biddeth vs beware, least wee communicat with other
mens sinnes; &amp; this their dooing is not only to communicat with other
mens sinnes, &amp; maintain euil to the destruction of them selues &amp; many
others, but also a maintaining of a great sorte of idle lubbers, and
buzzing dronets, to suck vp and deuoure the good honie, wherupon the
poor bees should liue.’ Exhorts ‘all players &amp; Founders of plaies and
enterluds’ to leave their life. P. 146. ‘Away therfore with this so
infamous an art! for goe they neuer so braue, yet are they counted and
taken but for beggers. And is it not true? liue they not vpon begging
of euery one that comes? Are they not taken by the lawes of the Realm
for roagues and vacaboundes? I speak of such as trauaile the Cuntries
with playes &amp; enterludes, making an occupation of it, and ought so
to be punished, if they had their deserts.’ <i>Lords of Misrule in

to rent, teare, and kill another, and all for his foolish pleasure?...
And, to be plaine, I thinke the Deuill is the Maister of the game,
bearward and all.’ <i>A Fearfull Example of God his Iudgement vpon

13 Jan. 1583, with the page-heading, ‘A wofull cry at Syrap garden’.
‘So that either two or three hundred men, women, and children (by
estimation), wherof seuen were killed dead, some were wounded, some
lamed, and othersome brused and crushed almost to the death.’ <i>A
fearfull Iudgement of God, shewed at the Theaters.</i> P. 180. ‘The
like Iudgement (almost) did the Lord shew vnto them a litle befor,
being assembled at their Theaters, to see their bawdie enterluds and
other trumperies practised: For he caused the earth mightely to shak
and quauer, as though all would haue fallen down; wherat the People,
sore amazed, some leapt down (from the top of the turrets, pinacles,
and towres, wher they stood) to the ground; wherof some had their legs
broke, some their arms, some their backs, some hurt one where, some
another, and many sore crusht and brused; but not any but they went
away sore affraid, &amp; wounded in conscience. And yet can neither the one

consume them all in his wrath; <i>which God forbid</i>! The Lord of his

<p>[From <i>The Defence of Poesie</i> (1595, William Ponsonby; S.
R. 29 Nov. 1594), reprinted as <i>An Apologie for Poetrie</i>
(1595, Henry Olney), and with 1598 and later editions of
<i>Arcadia</i>. Among many modern editions are those by E. Arber
(1868), E. Flügel (1889), A. S. Cook (1890), E. S. Schuckburgh
(1891), J. C. Collins (1907), and in Gregory Smith (1904), i.
148. The date 1583 is conjecturally assigned by Cook on the
ground of the stylistic development since the <i>Arcadia</i>
(1580–3). But any date is possible between 1579, when Gosson’s
<i>School of Abuse</i>, which probably stimulated it, and
Spenser’s <i>Faerie Queene</i>, which it mentions, appeared,
and Nov. 1585, when Sidney went to the Low Countries. The book
contains a general valuation of poetry, on humanistic lines,
together with a criticism of English poetry in particular. Only
a few pages are devoted to the drama.]</p>
</div>

<p>P. 44. ‘Perchance it is the Comick, whom naughtie Playmakers and
Stagekeepers, have iustly made odious. To the argument of abuse, I will
answer after. Onely thus much now is to be said, that the Comedy is
an imitation of the common errors of our life, which he representeth,
in the most ridiculous and scornefull sort that may be. So as it is
impossible, that any beholder can be content to be such a one.... So
that the right vse of Comedy will (I thinke) by no body be blamed,
and much lesse of the high and excellent Tragedy, that openeth the
greatest wounds, and sheweth forth the Vlcers, that are couered with
Tissue: that maketh Kinges feare to be Tyrants, and Tyrants manifest
their tirannicall humors: that with sturring the affects of admiration
and commiseration, teacheth, the vncertainety of this world, and vpon
how weake foundations guilden roofes are builded.... But it is not
the Tragedy they doe mislike: For it were too absurd to cast out so
excellent a representation of whatsoeuer is most worthy to be learned.’
P. 50. Answers criticisms of poetry as the ‘Nurse of abuse’, &amp;c. P.
63. Criticizes ‘Our Tragedies and Comedies (not without cause cried
out against)’. Even in <i>Gorboduc</i>, much more in other plays, the
unities are disregarded (cf. quotations in ch. xix). ‘Besides these
gross absurdities, how all theyr Playes be neither right Tragedies,
nor right Comedies: mingling Kings and Clownes’ in a ‘mungrell
Tragy-comedie.... Our Comedians thinke there is no delight without
laughter.... Delight hath a ioy in it, either permanent, or present.
Laughter, hath onely a scornful tickling.... But I haue lauished out
too many wordes of this play matter. I doe it because as they are
excelling parts of Poesie, so is there none so much vsed in England,
and none can be more pittifully abused.’</p>

<h3>xl. 1588–90. <span class="smcap">Martin Marprelate Controversy.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The texts of the Marprelate pamphlets have been edited by
W. Pierce, <i>The Marprelate Tracts</i> (1911); some were
reprinted earlier by E. Arber and in J. Petheram, <i>Puritan
Discipline Tracts</i> (1842–60). The best accounts of this
ribald controversy on Church government are E. Arber, <i>An
Introductory Sketch to the Martin Marprelate Controversy</i>
(1879); W. Pierce, <i>Historical Introduction to the
Marprelate Tracts</i> (1908); J. D. Wilson, <i>The Marprelate
Controversy</i> (1909, C. H. iii. 374), and <i>Martin Marprelate
and Shakespeare’s Fluellen</i> (1912); R. B. McKerrow, <i>Works
of Nashe</i>, v (1910), 34, 184; G. Bonnard, <i>La Controverse
de Martin Marprelate</i> (1916). It seems probable that Martin
was a composite personality; Sir Roger Williams, John Penry,
and Job Throckmorton may all have had a share in the pamphlets.
The replies were inspired by Richard Bancroft, then Canon of
Westminster and a member of the High Commission. It seems clear
that both Lyly and Nashe took part in them, and <i>Pappe with
an Hatchet</i> may reasonably be ascribed to Lyly. Nashe has
often been regarded as Pasquil, but Mr. McKerrow does not think
that any of the pamphlets can be supposed with any certainty
to be his; he probably contributed to the lost plays. Of
these Bonnard, 92, would distinguish five&mdash;(<i>a</i>) Martin
anatomized, (<i>b</i>) the May Game of Martinism, (<i>c</i>)
Martin carried to hell, as a vice, (<i>d</i>) Martin as
cock, ape, and wolf, (<i>e</i>) Martin ravishing Divinity;
but (<i>b</i>) seems to be referred to as a forthcoming
pamphlet rather than as a play, and of the others (<i>d</i>)
and (<i>e</i>) almost certainly, and possibly all four, were
episodes in the same piece. F. Bacon in his <i>Advertisement
Touching the Controversies</i> (<i>Works</i>, viii. 74), written
in the summer of 1589, criticizes the episcopal policy of
answering like by like, and ‘this immodest and deformed manner
of writing lately entertained, whereby matters of religion are
handled in the style of the stage’.]</p>

<h3>xli. 1589. <span class="smcap">Richard (?) Puttenham.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[From <i>The Arte of English Poesie</i> (1589; S. R. 9 Nov.
1588), edited by E. Arber (1869); also in J. Haslewood,
<i>Ancient Critical Essays</i>, vol. i (1811), and in part in
Gregory Smith, ii. 1. On the author, cf. ch. xxiii.]</p>
</div>

<p>Most of the treatise (bks. ii, iii) deals with the technicalities of
poetic structure and style, which the author sometimes illustrates from
interludes and verses of his own. Bk. i praises poetry in general, on
familiar but non-controversial humanist lines, and discusses with some
classical erudition the origin of various types of poetry, as tragedy,
comedy, and pantomime (c. 11), comedy (c. 14), tragedy (c. 15), staging
(c. 17), pastoral (c. 18). In a brief account of English poets (c. 31)
occurs: ‘But the principall man in this profession at the same time
[Edward’s] was Maister Edward [<i>sic</i>] Ferrys a man of no lesse
mirth and felicitie that way, but of much more skil, and magnificence
in his meeter, and therefore wrate for the most part to the stage, in
Tragedie and sometimes in Comedie or Enterlude, wherein he gaue the
king so much good recreation, as he had thereby many good rewardes....
Of the later sort I thinke thus. That for Tragedie, the Lord of
Buckhurst and Maister Edward Ferrys for such doings as I haue sene of
theirs do deserue the hyest price: Th’ Earle of Oxford and Maister
Edwardes of her Maiesties Chappell for Comedy and Enterlude.’</p>

<h3>xlii. 1589. <span class="smcap">Thomas Nashe.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[From an epistle <i>To the Gentlemen Students of Both
Universities</i>, prefixed to Robert Greene’s <i>Menaphon</i>
(1589; S. R. 23 Aug. 1589), reprinted from ed. 1610, which has
some corrections possibly by Nashe, in McKerrow, iii. 311,
with valuable notes (iv. 444) upon the allusions and supposed
allusions. The suggestion of Collier that <i>Menaphon</i> was
originally printed in 1587 appears to be baseless. Outside
the three passages quoted, Nashe praises Watson’s translation
of <i>Antigone</i>. McKerrow’s collection of material for the
critical discussion of the epistle is so full that I need only
compare briefly my conclusions with his. In (i) Nashe seems
to me to be criticizing (<i>a</i>) ‘tragedians’, which for me
are clearly ‘tragic actors’, while McKerrow inclines to make
them ‘writers of tragedy’, and (<i>b</i>) their dramatists,
who include blank-verse ‘Art-masters’, which I agree with
McKerrow is more likely, in view of the fact that Greene above
all flourished his University degree, to mean ‘masters of
their art’ than ‘masters of Arts’, and translating tradesmen
or serving-men with no education beyond a grammar-school. The
slight suggestions that Nashe may have had Marlowe especially
in mind are perhaps hardly sufficient to outweigh his statement
in <i>Have with you to Saffron Walden</i> (1596) that he
‘neuer abusd Marloe’; and Marlowe was a University man, and
no tradesman or serving-man. On the other hand, there is no
specific praise of Marlowe with other University poets in the
epistle. The whole of (i) is a precise parallel to the following
lines by Thomas Brabine, also prefixed to <i>Menaphon</i>:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container1">
   <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="hangingindent">‘Come foorth you witts that vaunt the pompe of speach,</div>
        <div class="i1 hangingindent">And striue to thunder from a Stage-mans throate:</div>
        <div>View <i>Menaphon</i> a note beyond your reach;</div>
        <div class="i1 hangingindent">Whose sight will make your drumming descant doate:</div>
        <div>Players auaunt, you know not to delight;</div>
        <div class="hangingindent">Welcome sweete Shepheard; worth a Schollers sight.’</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="p-left">In (ii) I am rather more inclined than McKerrow to think that
the ‘<i>Nouerint</i>’ and the ‘Kidde in <i>Æsop</i>’ may glance
at Kyd, who was not one of the University group, and was a
grammarian, a translator, and very likely already a serving-man.
But the attempts to trace him elsewhere in the passage come to
very little; nor is one playwright only necessarily in question,
so that, although the ‘handfuls of Tragicall speeches’ may
point to a play of <i>Hamlet</i> as already extant in 1589,
the inference that Kyd was its author becomes extremely thin.
In (iii) Nashe attacks the players as parasitic on the poets,
in terms closely resembling those used later by Greene in his
<i>Groatsworth of Wit</i> (No. xlviii). Probably Roscius is
here Alleyn, and Caesar stands for the poets in general. I do
not agree with Fleay, <i>L. of S.</i> 10, 99, that the epistle
reflects a rivalry between the poets of the Queen’s men and
those of Pembroke’s, who indeed did not yet exist, or any other
company. The issue is between the University poets on the one
hand and the players and illiterate poets on the other.]</p>

<p>P. 311. ‘I am not ignorant how eloquent our gowned age is grown of
late; so that euery mechanicall mate abhorres the English he was borne
too, and plucks, with a solemne periphrasis, his <i>vt vales</i> from
the inkehorne: which I impute, not so much to the perfection of Arts,
as to the seruile imitation of vainglorious Tragedians, who contend
not so seriously to excell in action, as to embowell the cloudes in a
speech of comparison, thinking themselues more than initiated in Poets
immortality, if they but once get <i>Boreas</i> by the beard and the
heauenly Bull by the deaw-lap. But heerein I cannot so fully bequeath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
them to folly, as their ideot Art-masters, that intrude themselues to
our eares as the Alcumists of eloquence, who (mounted on the stage of
arrogance) think to out-braue better pennes with the swelling bumbast
of a bragging blanke verse. Indeede it may bee the ingrafted ouerflow
of some kil-cow conceit, that ouercloyeth their imagination with a
more than drunken resolution, being not extemporall in the inuention
of any other meanes to vent their manhoode, commits the disgestion of
their cholericke incumbrances to the spacious volubilitie of a drumming
decasillabon. Mongst this kind of men that repose eternitie in the
mouth of a Player, I can but ingrosse some deep read Grammarians, who,
hauing no more learning in their skull than will serue to take vp a
commoditie, nor Art in their braine than was nourished in a seruing
mans idlenesse, will take vppon them to be the ironicall Censors of
all, when God and Poetrie doth know they are the simplest of all. To
leaue these to the mercy of their Mother tongue, that feed on nought
but the crums that fall from the Translators trencher, I come (sweet
friend) to thy <i>Arcadian Menaphon</i>, ...’ P. 315. ‘I’le turne
backe to my first text of Studies of delight, and talke a little in
friendship with a few of our triuiall translators. It is a common
practise now a dayes amongst a sort of shifting companions, that
runne through euery Art and thriue by none, to leaue the trade of
<i>Nouerint</i>, whereto they were borne, and busie themselues with the
indeuours of Art, that could scarcely Latinize their neck verse if they
should haue neede; yet English <i>Seneca</i> read by Candlelight yeelds
many good sentences, as <i>Blood is a begger</i>, and so forth; and
if you intreate him faire in a frostie morning, hee will affoord you
whole <i>Hamlets</i>, I should say handfuls of Tragicall speeches. But
O griefe! <i>Tempus edax rerum</i>, whats that will last alwayes? The
Sea exhaled by droppes will in continuance bee drie, and <i>Seneca</i>,
let blood line by line and page by page, at length must needes die to
our Stage; which makes his famished followers to imitate the Kidde
in <i>Æsop</i>, who, enamoured with the Foxes newfangles, forsooke
all hopes of life to leape into a newe occupation; and these men,
renouncing all possibilities of credite or estimation, to intermeddle
with Italian Translations: wherein how poorely they haue plodded, (as
those that are neither prouenzall men, nor are able to distinguish of
Articles,) let all indifferent Gentlemen that haue trauailed in that
tongue discerne by their two-pennie pamphlets: &amp; no maruell though
their home borne mediocritie bee such in this matter; for what can
bee hoped of those that thrust <i>Elisium</i> into hell, and haue not
learned, so long as they haue liued in the Spheres, the iust measure
of the Horizon without an hexameter? Sufficeth them to bodge vp a
blanke verse with ifs and ands, and otherwhile for recreation after
their Candle-stuffe, hauing starched their beards most curiously, to
make a Peripateticall path into the inner parts of the Citie, and
spend two or three howers in turning ouer French <i>Doudie</i>, where
they attract more infection in one minute, then they can do eloquence
all daies of their life, by conuersing with any Authors of like
argument.’ P. 323. ‘There are extant about <i>London</i> many most
able men to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span> reuiue Poetry ... as, for example, <i>Mathew Roydon</i>,
<i>Thomas Atchelow</i>, and <i>George Peele</i>; the first of whom,
as he hath shewed himselfe singular in the immortall Epitaph of his
beloued <i>Astrophell</i>, besides many other most absolute Comike
inuentions (made more publike by euery mans praise, than they can be
by my speech), so the second hath more than once or twice manifested
his deepe witted schollership in places of credite: and for the last,
though not the least of them all, I dare commend him to all that know
him, as the chiefe supporter of pleasance now liuing, the <i>Atlas</i>
of Poetrie, and <i>primus verborum Artifex</i>: whose first increase,
the arraignement of <i>Paris</i>, might pleade to your opinions
his pregnant dexterity of wit, and manifold varietie of inuention;
where in (<i>me iudice</i>) he goeth a steppe beyond all that write.
Sundry other sweete gentlemen I know, that haue vaunted their pennes
in priuate deuices, and tricked vp a company of taffata fooles with
their feathers, whose beauty if our Poets had not peecte with the
supply of their periwigs, they might haue antickt it vntill this time

euery day at the pease porredge ordinary with <i>Delphrigus</i>. But
<i>Tolossa</i> hath forgot that it was sometime sacked, and beggars
that euer they carried their fardels on footback: and in truth no
meruaile, when as the deserued reputation of one <i>Roscius</i> is
of force to enrich a rabble of counterfets; yet let subiects for all
their insolence dedicate a <i>De profundis</i> euery morning to the

<p>P. 129. A palmer, telling the tale of Francesco, which contains
some probably autobiographical matter on the hero’s writing for the
stage (cf. ch. xxiii, s.v. Greene), is interrupted by a request for
his ‘iudgement of Playes, Playmakers and Players’. After observing
that ‘some for being too lauish against that facultie, haue for
their satiricall inuectiues been well canuased’, he sketches the
growth of comedy at Athens and Rome, where ‘couetousnesse crept into
the qualitie’ and ‘the Actors, by continuall vse grewe not onely
excellent, but rich and insolent’. This is illustrated (p. 132) by a
rebuke of Cicero to Roscius, ‘Why <i>Roscius</i>, art thou proud with
<i>Esops</i> Crow, being pranct with the glorie of others feathers? of
thy selfe thou canst say nothing, and if the Cobler hath taught thee to
say Aue Caesar, disdain not thy tutor, because thou pratest in a Kings
chamber: what sentence thou vtterest on the stage, flowes from the
censure of our wittes, and what sentence or conceipte of the inuention
the people applaud for excellent, that comes from the secrets of our
knowledge. I graunt your action, though it be a kind of mechanical
labour; yet wel done tis worthie of praise: but you worthlesse, if for
so small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span> a toy you waxe proud’. <i>Publius Seruilius</i> also bade a
player ‘bee not so bragge of thy silken roabes, for I sawe them but
yesterday make a great shew in a broakers shop’. The palmer concludes,
‘Thus sir haue you heard my opinion briefly of plaies, that Menander
deuised them for the suppressing of vanities, necessarie in a common
wealth, as long as they are vsed in their right kind; the play makers
worthy of honour for their Arte: &amp; players, men deseruing both prayse

Regrets present toleration of ‘these dangerous schools of licentious

Now ‘rich men give more to a player for a song which he shall sing in
one hour, than to their faithful servants for serving them a whole
year.... I could wish that players would use themselves nowadays, as
in ancient former times they have done, which was only to exercise
their interludes in the time of Christmas, beginning to play in the
holidays and continuing until twelfth tide, or at the furthest until
Ashwednesday, of which players I find three sorts of people: the first,
such as were in wages with the king and played before him some time at
Hallowmass, and then in the later holidays until twelfthtide, and after
that, only in Shrovetide; and these men had other trades to live of,
and seldom or never played abroad at any other times of the whole year.
The second sort were such as pertained to noblemen, and were ordinary
servants in their house, and only for Christmas times used such plays,
without making profession to be players to go abroad for gain, for in
such cases they were subject to the statute against retainers. The
third sort were certain artisans in good towns and great parishes, as
shoemakers, tailors, and such like, that used to play either in their
town-halls, or some time in churches, to make the people merry; where
it was lawful for all persons to come without exacting any money for
their access, having only somewhat gathered of the richer sort by the
churchwardens for their apparel and other necessaries.’</p>

at <i>S. Iohns</i> in Cambridge, of <i>Richard the 3</i>, would moue
(I thinke) <i>Phalaris</i> the tyraunt, and terrifie all tyrannous
minded men from following their foolish ambitious humors, seeing how
his ambition made him kill his brother, his nephews, his wife, beside
infinit others, and, last of all, after a short and troublesome raigne,
to end his miserable life, and to haue his body harried after his
death. Then, for Comedies, how full of harmeles myrth is our Cambridge
<i>Pedantius</i>? and the Oxford <i>Bellum Grammaticale</i>? or, to
speake of a London Comedie, how much good matter, yea and matter of
state, is there in that Comedie cald the play of the Cards, in which
it is showed how foure Parasiticall knaues robbe the foure principall
vocations of the Realme, <i>videl</i>, the vocation of Souldiers,
Schollers, Marchants, and Husbandmen? Of which Comedie I cannot forget
the saying of a notable wise counseller that is now dead, who when some
(to sing <i>Placebo</i>) aduised that it should be forbidden, because
it was somewhat too plaine, and indeed as the old saying is, <i>sooth
boord is no boord</i>, yet he would haue it allowed, adding it was fit
that <i>They which doe that they should not should heare that they
would not</i>.’</p>

<p>[Extracts.] P. 211. ‘There is a certaine waste of the people for whome
there is no vse, but warre: and these men must haue some employment
still to cut them off.... To this effect, the pollicie of Playes is
very necessary, howsoeuer some shallow-braind censurers (not the
deepest serchers into the secrets of gouernment) mightily oppugne
them. For whereas the after-noone beeing the idlest time of the day;
wherein men that are their owne masters (as Gentlemen of the Court,
the Innes of the Courte, and the number of Captaines and Souldiers
about <i>London</i>) do wholy bestow themselues vpon pleasure, and
that pleasure they deuide (howe vertuously it skils not) either into
gameing, following of harlots, drinking, or seeing a Playe: is it not
then better (since of foure extreames all the world cannot keepe them
but they will choose one) that they should betake them to the least,
which is Playes? Nay, what if I prooue Playes to be no extreame; but
a rare exercise of vertue? First, for the subiect of them (for the
most part) it is borrowed out of our English Chronicles, wherein our
forefathers valiant acts (that haue line long buried in rustie brasse
and worme-eaten bookes) are reuiued, and they themselues raised from
the Graue of Obliuion, and brought to pleade their aged Honours in
open presence: than which, what can be a sharper reproofe to these
degenerate effeminate dayes of ours? How would it haue ioyed braue
<i>Talbot</i> (the terror of the French) to thinke that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span> after he had
lyne two hundred yeares in his Tombe, hee should triumphe againe on
the Stage, and haue his bones newe embalmed with the teares of ten
thousand spectators at least (at seuerall times) who, in the Tragedian
that represents his person, imagine they behold him fresh bleeding?
I will defend it against any Collian, or clubfisted Vsurer of them
all, there is no immortalitie can be giuen a man on earth like vnto
Playes.... All Artes to them are vanitie: and, if you tell them what
a glorious thing it is to haue <i>Henrie</i> the fifth represented on
the Stage, leading the French King prisoner, and forcing both him and
the Dolphin to sweare fealty, I, but (will they say) what do we get by
it? Respecting neither the right of Fame that is due to true Nobilitie
deceased, nor what hopes of eternitie are to be proposed to aduentrous
mindes, to encourage them forward, but onely their execrable luker, and
fillthie vnquenchable auarice. They know when they are dead they shall
not be brought vpon the Stage for any goodnes, but in a merriment of
the Vsurer and the Diuel, or buying Armes of the Herald, who giues them
the Lyon, without tongue, tayle, or tallents, because his maister whome
hee must serue is a Townesman, and a man of peace, and must not keepe
any quarrelling beasts to annoy his honest neighbours. In Playes, all
coosonages, all cunning drifts ouer-guylded with outward holinesse,
all stratagems of warre, all the cankerwormes that breede on the rust
of peace, are most liuely anatomiz’d: they shewe the ill successe of
treason, the fall of hastie climbers, the wretched end of vsurpers, the
miserie of ciuill dissention, and how iust God is euermore in punishing
of murther.... Whereas some Petitioners of the Counsaile against them
obiect, they corrupt the youth of the Cittie, and withdrawe Prentises
from theyr worke; they heartily wishe they might bee troubled with none
of their youth nor their prentises; for some of them (I meane the ruder
handicrafts seruants) neuer come abroade, but they are in danger of
vndoing: and as for corrupting them when they come, thats false; for no
Play they haue, encourageth any man to tumult or rebellion, but layes
before such the halter and the gallowes; or praiseth or approoueth
pride, lust, whoredome, prodigalitie, or drunkennes, but beates them
downe vtterly. As for the hindrance of Trades and Traders of the Citie
by them, that is an Article foysted in by the Vintners, Alewiues, and
Victuallers, who surmise, if there were no Playes, they should haue
all the companie that resort to them, lye bowzing and beere-bathing in
their houses euery after-noone.... Our Players are not as the players
beyond Sea, a sort of squirting baudie Comedians, that haue whores
and common Curtizens to playe womens partes, and forbeare no immodest
speech or vnchast action that may procure laughter; but our Sceane is
more statelye furnisht than euer it was in the time of <i>Roscius</i>,

of Emperours, Kings, and Princes; whose true Tragedies (<i>Sophocleo

<p>A jury is being empanelled between the disputants, who represent new

veluet and satin’ is followed by ‘two pert Applesquires: the one had
a murrey cloth gowne on, faced down before with gray conny, and laid
thicke on the sleeves with lace, which he quaintly bare vp to shew his
white taffata hose, and black silk stockings: a huge ruffe about his
necke wrapt in his great head like a wicker cage, a little Hat with
brims like the wings of a doublet, wherein he wore a jewell of glasse,
as broad as a chancery seale: after him followed two boies in cloakes
like butterflies: carrying one of them his cutting sword of choller,
the other his dauncing rapier of delight.’ The ‘ouerworne gentleman’ is
a poet, the ‘applesquires’ a player and the usher of a dancing school.
Velvet Breeches thinks the poet ‘a proud fellow’, the others ‘plaine,
honest, humble men, that for a penny or an old-cast sute of apparell
will do anything. Indeed quoth Cloth Breeches you say troth, they are

too full of selfe liking and selfe loue, and is vnfit to be of the Iury
though I hide and conceale his faults and fopperies, in that I haue
beene merry at his sports: onely this I must say, that such a plaine

<p>‘<i>Roberto</i> ... vttered his present greefe, beseeching his advuise
how he might be imployed. Why easily, quoth hee, and greatly to your
benefit: for men of my profession get by schollers their whole liuing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
What is your profession, sayd <i>Roberto</i>? Truely sir, said he, I
am a player. A Player, quoth <i>Roberto</i>, I tooke you rather for
a gentleman of great liuing; for if by outward habit men shuld be
censured, I tell you, you would be taken for a substantiall man. So
am I where I dwell (quoth the player) reputed able at my proper cost,
to build a Windmill. What though the worlde once went hard with mee,
when I was faine to carrie my playing Fardle a footebacke; <i>Tempora
mutantur</i>: I know you know the meaning of it better than I, but I
thus conster it, it is otherwise now; for my very share in playing
apparrell will not be solde for two hundred pounds. Truely (said
<i>Roberto</i>) it is strange, that you should so prosper in that vaine
practise, for that it seemes to me your voyce is nothing gracious. Nay
then, said the player, I mislike your iudgement: why, I am as famous
for Delphrigus, and the king of Fairies, as euer was any of my time.
The twelue labors of <i>Hercules</i> haue I terribly thundred on the
stage, and plaied three scenes of the deuill in the highway to heauen.
Haue ye so (said <i>Roberto</i>?) then I pray you pardon me. Nay more
(quoth the player) I can serue to make a prettie speech, for I was a
countrie Author, passing at a morrall, for it was I that pende the
Morral of mans wit, the Dialogue of Diues, and for seauen yeeres space
was absolute interpreter of the puppets. But now my Almanacke is out of

  </div>

<p>Was not this prettie for a plaine rime extempore? if ye will, ye shall
haue more. Nay it is enough, said <i>Roberto</i>, but how meane you to
vse mee? Why sir, in making playes, said the other, for which you shall
be well paied, if you will take the paines.... Roberto, now famozed
for an Arch-plaimaking-poet, his purse like the sea sometime sweld,
anon like the same sea fell to a low ebbe; yet seldom he wanted, his
labors were so well esteemed. Marry, this rule he kept, what euer he
fingerd afore-hand, was the certaine meanes to vnbinde a bargaine; and
being asked why he so sleightly dealt with them that did him good? It
becomes me, sath hee, to be contrarie to the worlde: for commonly when
vulgar men recieue earnest, they doe performe; when I am paid any thing
afore-hand, I breake my promise.... <i>To those Gentlemen, his Quondam
acquaintance, that spend their wits in making Plaies, R. G. wisheth
a better exercise, and wisdome to preuent his extremities</i>....
Base minded men al three of you, if by my miserie ye be not warned:
for vnto none of you (like me) sought those burres to cleaue: those
Puppits (I meane) that speake from our mouths, those Anticks garnisht
in our colours. Is it not strange that I, to whom they al haue beene
beholding: is it not like that you, to whome they all haue beene
beholding, shall (were ye in that case that I am now) be both at once
of them forsaken? Yes, trust them not: for there is an vpstart Crow,
beautified with our feathers, that with his <i>Tygers heart wrapt
in a Players hide</i>, supposes he is as well able to bumbast out a
blank verse as the best of you: and being an absolute <i>Iohannes
fac totum</i>, is in his owne conceit the onely Shake-scene in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span> a

profitable courses: &amp; let these Apes imitate your past excellence,
and neuer more acquaint them with your admired inuentions. I know the
best husband of you all will neuer proue an Vsurer, and the kindest of
them all wil neuer prooue a kinde nurse: yet, whilst you may, seeke
you better Maisters; for it is pittie men of such rare wits, should be
subiect to the pleasures of such rude groomes. In this I might insert
two more, that both haue writ against these buckram Gentlemen: but let
their owne works serue to witnesse against their owne wickednesse,
if they perseuer to maintaine any more such peasants. For other new
commers, I leaue them to the mercie of these painted monsters, who (I
doubt not) will driue the best minded to despise them: for the rest, it
skils not though they make a ieast at them.’ Cf. ch. xxiii, s.v. Greene.</p>

<p>P. 37. <i>To the Gentlemen Readers.</i> ‘About three moneths since
died M. <i>Robert Greene</i>, leauing many papers in sundry Booke
sellers hands, among other his Groatsworth of wit, in which a letter
written to diuers playmakers, is offensiuely by one or two of them
taken; and because on the dead they cannot be auenged, they wilfully
forge in their conceites a liuing Author: and after tossing it two
and fro, no remedy, but it must light on me. How I haue all the time
of my conuersing in printing hindered the bitter inueying against
schollers, it hath been very well knowne; and how in that I dealt, I
can sufficiently prooue. With neither of them that take offence was I
acquainted, and with one of them I care not if I neuer be: The other,
whome at that time I did not so much spare, as since I wish I had,
for that as I haue moderated the heate of liuing writers, and might
haue vsde my owne discretion (especially in such a case) the Author
beeing dead, that I did not, I am as sory as if the originall fault
had beene my fault, because my selfe haue seene his demeanor no lesse
ciuill, than he exelent in the qualitie he professes: Besides, diuers
of worship haue reported his vprightnes of dealing, which argues his
honesty, and his facetious grace in writting, that aprooues his Art.
For the first, whose learning I reuerence, and at the perusing of
<i>Greenes</i> Booke, stroke out what then in conscience I thought he
in some displeasure writ: or had it beene true, yet to publish it,
was intollerable: him I would wish to vse me no worse than I deserue.
I had onely in the copy this share: it was il written, as sometime<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
<i>Greenes</i> hand was none of the best; licensd it must be, ere it
could bee printed, which could neuer be if it might not be read. To be
breife, I writ it ouer; and as neare as I could, followed the copy;
onely in that letter I put something out, but in the whole booke not
a worde in; for I protest it was all <i>Greenes</i>, not mine nor
Maister <i>Nashes</i>, as some vniustly haue affirmed.’ <i>Henrie
Chettle</i>.... <i>The Dreame</i>. P. 43. ‘There entered at once fiue
personages.... The next, by his sute of russet, his buttond cap, his
taber, his standing on the toe, and other tricks, I knew to be either
the body or resemblaunce of Tarlton, who liuing, for his pleasant
conceits was of all men liked, and dying, for mirth left not his
like.... With him was the fifth, a man of indifferent yeares, of face
amible, of body well proportioned, his attire after the habite of a
schollerlike Gentleman, onely his haire was somewhat long, whome I
supposed to be Robert Greene, maister of Artes: of whome (howe euer
some suppose themselues iniured) I haue learned to speake, considering
he is dead, <i>nill nisi necessarium</i>. He was of singuler pleasaunce
the verye supporter, and, to no man’s disgrace bee this intended,
the only Comedian of a vulgar writer in this country.’ P. 63. <i>To
all maligners of honest mirth</i>, Tarleton <i>wisheth continuall
melancholy</i>. ‘Now Maisters, what say you to a merrie knaue, that for
this two years day hath not beene talkt of. Wil you giue him leaue, if
he can, to make ye laugh? What, all a mort? No merry countenance? Nay
then I see hypocrisie hath the vpper hand, and her spirit raignes in
this profitable generation. Sith it is thus, Ile be a time-pleaser.
Fie vppon following plaies, the expence is wondrous; vpon players
speeches, their wordes are full of wyles; vppon their gestures, that
are altogether wanton. Is it not lamentable, that a man should spende
his two pence on them in an after-noone, heare couetousnes amongst
them daily quipt at, being one of the commonest occupations in the
countrey; and in liuely gesture see trecherie set out, with which euery
man now adaies vseth to intrap his brother. Byr lady, this would be
lookt into: if these be the fruites of playing, tis time the practisers
were expeld. Expeld (quoth you); that hath been pretily performd, to
the no smal profit of the Bouling-allyes in Bedlam and other places,
that were wont in the after-noones to be left empty, by the recourse
of good fellows vnto that vnprofitable recreation of Stage-playing.
And it were not much amisse, would they ioine with the Dicing houses
to make sute againe for their longer restraint, though the sicknesse
cease. Is not this well saide (my maisters) of an olde buttond cappe,
that hath most part of his life liu’d vppon that against which he
inueighs: Yes, and worthily.’ Suppression of plays to the advantage of
bawdy-houses, especially those not near Shoreditch. Discourse with a
pander. P. 65. ‘And you, sir, find fault with plaies. Out vpon them,
they spoile our trade, as you your selfe haue proued. Beside, they
open our crosse-biting, our conny-catching, our traines, our traps,
our gins, our snares, our subtilties: for no sooner haue we a tricke
of deceipt, but they make it common, singing Iigs, and making ieasts
of vs, that euerie boy can point out our houses as they passe by.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
Whither now <i>Tarlton</i>? this is extempore, out of time, tune, and
temper.... Thy selfe once a Player, and against Players: nay, turne
out the right side of thy russet coate, and lette the world know
thy meaning. Why thus I meane, for now I speake in sobernes. Euery
thing hath in it selfe his vertue and his vice: from one selfe flower
the Bee and Spider sucke honny and poyson. In plaies it fares as in
bookes, vice cannot be reproued, except it be discouered: neither is
it in any play discouered, but there followes in the same an example
of the punishment: now he that at a play will be delighted in the
one, and not warned by the other, is like him that reads in a booke
the description of sinne, and will not looke ouer the leafe for the
reward. Mirth in seasonable time taken, is not forbidden by the
austerest Sapients. But indeede there is a time of mirth and a time of
mourning. Which time hauing been by the Magistrats wisely obserued, as
well for the suppressing of Playes, as other pleasures: so likewise a
time may come, when honest recreation shall haue his former libertie.
And lette <i>Tarleton</i> intreate the yoong people of the Cittie,
either to abstaine altogether from playes, or at their comming thither
to vse themselues after a more quiet order. In a place so ciuill as
this Cittie is esteemed, it is more than barbarously rude, to see the
shamefull disorder and routes that sometimes in such publike meetings
are vsed. The beginners are neither gentlemen, nor citizens, nor any
of both their seruants, but some lewd mates that long for innouation;
&amp; when they see aduantage, that either Seruingmen or Apprentises are
most in number, they will be of either side, though indeed they are of
no side, but men beside all honestie, willing to make boote of cloakes,
hats, purses, or what euer they can lay holde on in a hurley burley.
These are the common causers of discord in publike places. If otherwise
it happen (as it seldome doth) that any quarrell be betweene man and
man, it is far from manhood to make so publike a place their field to
fight in: no men will doe it, but cowardes that would faine be parted,
or haue hope to haue many partakers. Nowe to you that maligne our
moderate merriments, and thinke there is no felicitie but in excessiue
possession of wealth: with you I would ende in a song, yea an Extempore
song on this Theame, <i>Ne quid nimis necessarium</i>: but I am now
hoarse, and troubled with my Taber and Pipe: beside, what pleasure
brings musicke to the miserable. Therefore letting songes passe, I tell
them in sadnes, how euer Playes are not altogether to be commended: yet
some of them do more hurt in a day, than all the Players (by exercizing
theyr profession) in an age. Faults there are in the professors as
other men, this the greatest, that diuers of them beeing publike in
euerie ones eye, and talkt of in euery vulgar mans mouth, see not how
they are seene into, especially for their contempt, which makes them
among most men most contemptible. Of them I will say no more: of the
profession, so much hath <i>Pierce Pennilesse</i> (as I heare say)
spoken, that for mee there is not any thing to speake. So wishing
the chearefull, pleasaunce endlesse; and the wilfull sullen, sorrow
till they surfet; with a turne on the toe I take my leaue. <i>Richard
Tarleton.</i>’</p>

<p>Our famous and learned Lawreat masters of England would entitle our

Tragedians (the glorious and goodlie representers of all fine witte,
glorified phrase, and queint action) bee still supported and vphelde,
by which meanes for lacke of Patrones (O ingratefull and damned

patronized....</p>

<p>... <span class="smcap">A comparatiue discourse of our English poets with the Greeke,
Latine, and Italian poets</span>....</p>

<p>... As Plautus and Seneca are accounted the best for Comedy and
Tragedy among the Latines: so Shakespeare among the English is the
most excellent in both kinds for the stage. For Comedy, witnes his
<i>Gentlemen of Verona</i>, his <i>Errors</i>, his <i>Loue Labors
Lost</i>, his <i>Loue Labours Wonne</i>, his <i>Midsummers Night
Dreame</i>, and his <i>Merchant of Venice</i>; For Tragedy, his
<i>Richard the 2</i>, <i>Richard the 3</i>, <i>Henry the 4</i>, <i>King
Iohn</i>, <i>Titus Andronicus</i>, and his <i>Romeo and Iuliet</i>....</p>

<p>... These are our best for Tragedie, The Lorde Buckhurst, Doctor Leg
of Cambridge, Doctor Edes of Oxford, Master Edward Ferris, the author
of the <i>Mirror for Magistrates</i>, Marlow, Peele, Watson, Kid,
Shakespeare, Drayton, Chapman, Decker, and Beniamin Iohnson.</p>

<p>As M. Anneus Lucanus writ two excellent tragedies, one called
<i>Medea</i>, the other <i>De incendio Troiae cum Priami
calamitate</i>: so Doctor Leg hath penned two famous tragedies, the
one of <i>Richard the 3</i>, the other of <i>The Destruction of
Ierusalem</i>....</p>

<p>... The best for Comedy amongst vs bee Edward, Earle of Oxforde, Doctor
Gager of Oxforde, Master Rowley, once a rare scholler of learned
Pembrooke Hall in Cambridge, Maister Edwardes, one of Her Maiesties
Chappell, eloquent and wittie Iohn Lilly, Lodge, Gascoyne, Greene,
Shakespeare, Thomas Nash, Thomas Heywood, Anthony Mundye, our best
plotter, Chapman, Porter, Wilson, Hathway, and Henry Chettle....</p>

<p>As Georgius Buchananus’ <i>Iepthae</i> amongst all moderne Tragedies
is able to abide the touch of Aristotle’s precepts and Euripedes’s
examples: so is Bishop Watson’s <i>Absalon</i>. As ... Watson for his
<i>Antigone</i> out of Sophocles, ha[s] got good commendations: so
these versifiers for their learned translations are of good note among
vs ... the Translators of Seneca’s <i>Tragedies</i>, ... As Antipater
Sidonius was famous for extemporall verse in Greeke, and Ouid for
his <i>Quicquid conabar dicere versus erat</i>: so was our Tarleton,
of whome Doctor Case, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span> learned physitian, thus speaketh in the
Seuenth Booke and seuenteenth chapter of his <i>Politikes: Aristoteles

<p>Must the holy Prophets and Patriarkes be set vpon a Stage, to be
derided, hist, and laught at? or is it fit that the infirmities of
holy men should be acted on a Stage, whereby others may be inharted
to rush carelessly forward into vnbrideled libertie?... Furthermore,
there is no passion wherwith the king, the soueraigne maiestie of the
Realme was possest, but is amplified, and openly sported with, and made
a May-game to all the beholders.... If a man will learne to be proud,
fantasticke, humorous, to make love, sweare, swagger, and in a word
closely doo any villanie, for a twopenny almes hee may be throughly
taught and made a perfect good scholler.... And as these copper-lace
gentlemen growe rich, purchase lands by adulterous Playes, &amp; not fewe
of them vsurers and extortioners, which they exhaust out of the purses
of their haunters, so are they puft vp in such pride and selfe-loue,
as they enuie their equalles, and scorne theyr inferiours.... But
especially these nocturnall and night Playes, at vnseasonable and
vndue times, more greater euils must necessarily proceed of them,
because they do not onely hide and couer the thiefe, but also entice
seruants out of their maisters houses, wherby opportunitie is offered
to loose fellowes, to effect many wicked stratagems.... To conclude,
it were further to be wished, that those admired wittes of this age,
Tragædians, and Comædians, that garnish Theaters with their inuentions,
would spend their wittes in more profitable studies, and leaue off to
maintaine those Anticks, and Puppets, that speake out of their mouthes:

<p>[From Epistle to <i>Volpone</i> (cf. ch. xxiii).]</p>
</div>

<p>Hence is it, that I now render my selfe gratefull, and am studious to
iustifie the bounty of your act: To which, though your mere authority
were satisfying, yet it being an age wherein <i>Poëtry</i> and the
Professors of it heare so ill on all sides, there will a reason bee
look’d for in the subject. It is certaine, nor can it with any forehead
be oppos’d, that the too-much licence of <i>Poëtasters</i> in this
time hath much deform’d their <i>Mistresse</i>; that euery day their
manifold and manifest ignorance doth stick vnnaturall reproches vpon
her. But for their petulancy, it were an act of the greatest iniustice,
either to let the learned suffer, or so diuine a <i>skill</i> (which
indeed should not be attempted with vncleane hands) to fall vnder the
least contempt. For if men will impartially, and not à-squint, looke
toward the offices and function of a <i>Poët</i>, they will easily
conclude to themselues the impossibility of any mans being the good
<i>Poët</i>, without first being a good <i>Man</i>. He that is sayd to
be able to informe <i>yong-men</i> to all good disciplines, inflame
<i>growne-men</i> to all great vertues, keepe <i>old men</i> in their
best and supreme state, or as they decline to child-hood, recouer
them to their first strength; that comes forth the Interpreter and
Arbiter of <i>Nature</i>, a Teacher of things diuine no lesse than
humane, a Master in manners; and can alone, or with a few, effect the
busines of Mankind. This, I take him, is no subject for <i>Pride</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
and <i>Ignorance</i> to exercise their railing <i>rhetorique</i>
vpon. But it will here be hastily answer’d, that the <i>Writers</i>
of these dayes are other things; that not onely their manners, but
their natures, are inuerted, and nothing remaining with them of the
dignity of <i>Poët</i>, but the abused name, which euery Scribe
vsurpes; that now, especially in <i>Dramatick</i>, or (as they terme
it) Stage-<i>Poëtry</i>, nothing but Ribaldry, Profanation, Blasphemy,
al Licence of offence to God, and Man, is practisd. I dare not deny
a great part of this, and am sory I dare not: because in some mens
abortiue <i>Features</i> (and would they had neuer boasted the light)
it is ouer-true. But that all are embarqu’d in this bold aduenture for
Hell, is a most vncharitable thought, and vtterd, a more malicious
slander. For my particular, I can, and from a most cleare conscience,
affirme, that I haue euer trembled to thinke toward the least
Prophanenesse; haue loathed the vse of such foule and vn-washd Baudr’y,

<p>[From <i>The Sermon preached at the Crosse, Feb. xiiij. 1607</i>
(1608, 2nd ed. 1609). Crashaw was preacher at the Inner Temple
and father of Richard Crashaw, the poet. The hypocrites,
Nicholas Saint-Tantlings and Simon Saint-Mary-Oueries, are
characters in <i>The Puritan</i> (1607). John Selden says in his
<i>Table Talk</i> (1689; ed. Reynolds, 134), ‘I never converted
but two, the one was Mr. Crashaw from writing against plays, by
telling him a way how to understand that place, of putting on

Papists, and from them to vs? Of this euill and plague, the Church
of God in all ages can say, truly and with a good conscience, <i>wee

this they are daily made to know, but all in vaine, they be children
of Babylon that will not bee healed: nay, they grow worse and worse,
for now they bring religion and holy things vpon the stage: no maruel
though the worthiest and mightiest men escape not, when God himselfe is
so abused. Two hypocrites must be brought foorth; and how shall they
be described but by these names, <i>Nicolas S. Antlings</i>, <i>Simon
S. Maryoueries</i>. Thus hypocrisie a child of hell must beare the
names of two Churches of God, and two wherein Gods name is called on
publikely euery day in the yeere, and in one of them his blessed word
preached euerie day (an example scarce matchable in the world): yet
these two, wherin Gods name is thus glorified, and our Church and State
honoured, shall bee by these miscreants thus dishonoured, and that
not on the stage only, but euen in print.’ Complains of profaneness,
atheism, blasphemy, and profaning of Sabbath ‘which generally in the
countrie is their play day’. Calls on magistrate, lest God take the
matter into his own hand.</p>

<h3>lvii. 1608 (?). <span class="smcap">Thomas Heywood.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[From <i>An Apology for Actors. Containing three briefe
Treatises. 1. Their Antiquity. 2. Their ancient Dignity. 3.
The True Use of their Quality</i> (1612), reprinted by William
Cartwright as <i>The Actor’s Vindication</i> (<span class="allsmcap">N.D.</span>,
but according to Douce 1658) and in 1841 (<i>Sh. Soc.</i>). I
think the treatise was probably written in 1607 and touched up
in 1608, since (<i>a</i>) the series of actors named as dead
ends with Sly, who died in Aug. 1608; (<i>b</i>) the Revels
Office is located at St. John’s, which it lost about Feb.
1608; (<i>c</i>) the frustrated Spanish landing in ‘Perin’ in
Cornwall ‘some 12 yeares ago’ is probably the abortive Spanish
attempt to burn Pendennis Castle on Falmouth Harbour, 3 miles
from Penrhyn, which appears from <i>S. P. D. Eliz.</i> cclvi,
21, 40, and Dasent, xxv. 15, to have taken place in the autumn
of 1595, probably in connexion with the better-known landing
of 22 July 1595 in Mount’s Bay. Here there is a Perranuthnoe,
but this was a successful landing, resulting in serious damage
to Penzance, Mousehole, and Newlyn (<i>Procl.</i> 879). There
was also a raid at Cawsand Bay near Plymouth on 14 Mar. 1596
(<i>S. P. D. Eliz.</i> cclvi. 89), in which the invaders fired
some houses and boats, and fled to sea on a shot being fired.
But there is no ‘Perin’ in Cawsand Bay. In <i>Journal of the
Folk-Song Society</i>, v. 275, is recorded a tradition that
‘the French once landed invading troops at Padstow Bay; but on
seeing a number of mummers in red cloaks with their hobby-horse
they supposed that the English army was at hand, and fled’.
This raid was at St. Eval, 3 miles west of Padstow, on 13 July
1595 (<i>Hatfield MSS.</i> v. 285), and no doubt formed part
of the same expedition which reached Mount’s Bay. Of course
it was Spanish, not French; the perversion is characteristic
of tradition. Conceivably this episode was what Heywood had
in mind, but the nearest ‘Perin’, Perranporth, is some dozen
miles farther west than St. Evall. Heywood was answered by I.
G. in <i>A Refutation of the Apology for Actors</i> (1615),
which contributes nothing new, and uses material from Gosson’s
<i>Plays Confuted</i> (No. xxx), with references to the
long-destroyed Theatre unchanged.]</p>

to see a Hector all besmered in blood, trampling upon the bulkes of
kinges; a Troilus returning from the field, in the sight of his father
Priam, as if man and horse, even from the steed’s rough fetlockes to
the plume on the champion’s helmet, had bene together plunged into a

Cerberus in chaynes, and lastly, on his high pyramides waiting <i>Nil

bold Englishman presented, and doth not hugge his fame, and hunnye
at his valor, pursuing him in his enterprise with his best wishes,
and as beeing wrapt in contemplation, offers to him in his hart all
prosperous performance, as if the personator were the man personated?
so bewitching a thing is lively and well-spirited action, that it
hath power to new-mold the harts of the spectators, and fashion them
to the shape of any noble and notable attempt. What coward, to see
his countrymen valiant, would not bee ashamed of his owne cowardise?
What English prince, should hee behold the true portrature of that
famous King Edward the Third, foraging France, taking so great a king
captive in his owne country, quartering the English lyons with the
French flower-delyce, and would not bee suddenly inflam’d with so

wish, that such as are condemned for their licentiousnesse, might by
a generall consent bee quite excluded our society; for, as we are

Kid, in his Spanish Tragedy’. <i>Book iii.</i> The quality not to be
condemned because of its abuses. P. 52. ‘Playing is an ornament to the
citty.’ It refines the language, instructs the ignorant, and teaches
moral lessons. P. 54. ‘Briefly, there is neither tragedy, history,
comedy, morall, or pastorall, from which an infinite use cannot be
gathered. I speake not in the defence of any lascivious shewes,
scurrelous jests, or scandalous invectives. If there be any such I
banish them quite from my patronage.’ Plays have discovered murders. P.
57. ‘We will prove it by a domestike and home-borne truth, which within
these few years happened. At Lin, in Norfolke, the then Earl of Sussex
players acting the old History of Feyer Francis’ drove a townswoman to
confess the murder of her husband in circumstances parallel to those
of the play. P. 58. Relates rout of Spanish raiders ‘at a place called
Perin in Cornwall’, though their alarm at the drum and trumpets of ‘a
company of the same quality some 12 yeares ago, or not so much ...
playing late in the night’. Another story of a woman who had driven a
nail into her husband’s brain, urged to remorse by a similar incident
in ‘the last part of the Four Sons of Aymon’ played by ‘a company of
our English comedians (well knowne)’ at Amsterdam. Summarizes the
favour of many sovereigns to players. P. 60. ‘The cardinal at Bruxels
hath at this time in pay a company of our English comedians.... But
in no country they are of that eminence that our’s are: so our most
royall and ever renouned soveraigne hath licenced us in London: so
did his predecessor, the thrice vertuous virgin, Queen Elizabeth;
and before her, her sister, Queene Mary, Edward the sixth, and their
father, Henry the eighth.’ P. 61. ‘Moreover, to this day in divers
places of England there be townes that held the priviledge of their
faires, and other charters by yearely stage-playes, as at Manningtree
in Suffolke, Kendall in the north, and others.... Now, to speake of
some abuse lately crept into the quality, as an inveighing against the
state, the court, the law, the citty, and their governements, with
the particularizing of private men’s humors (yet alive) noblemen, and
others: I know it distastes many; neither do I any way approve it,
nor dare I by any meanes excuse it. The liberty which some arrogate
to themselves, committing their bitternesse, and liberall invectives
against all estates, to the mouthes of children, supposing their
juniority to be a priviledge for any rayling, be it never so violent,
I could advise all such to curbe and limit this presumed liberty
within the bands of discretion and government. But wise and juditiall
censurers, before whom such complaints shall at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span> any time hereafter
come, wil not (I hope) impute these abuses to any transgression in us,
who have ever been carefull and provident to shun the like.’ P. 162.

<p>[The variant texts of this character are here given from the
two editions of John Stephens’ essays, in each of which it is
Bk. ii, char. 4, viz. (A) <i>Satyrical Essayes Characters and
Others</i> (1615) and (B) <i>Essayes and Characters, Ironical
and Instructive. The second impression</i> (1615), of which a
reprint is in J. O. Halliwell, <i>Old Books of Characters</i>
(1857), 131. Between A and B had appeared the sixth edition of
<i>The Wife</i>, with the character of <i>An Excellent Actor</i>
and the reference to a rival as ‘the imitating Characterist’ (v.
No. lxi). To this the additions in B are a rejoinder, and they
are reinforced by two epistles. One is ‘To the namelesse Rayler:
who hath lenghthened his Excellent Actor, a most needy Caracter
following the wife with a peece of dog-skin witt; dressed ouer
with oyle of sweaty Posthorse’. Here the writer, I. S., says he
did ‘admit a friends Satyre’. The other epistle, ‘To the nameles
Author of a late Character entituled, an <i>Excellent Actor</i>,
following <i>The Wife</i>’, is signed by ‘I. Cocke’, who says,
‘witnes your gross mistaking of approued and authorised actors
for counterfeit Runagates, or country Players, inueighed against
by the Characterist’. Some appended verses claim for Cocke
the authorship of the <i>Tinker</i>, <i>Apparator</i>, and
<i>Almanac-maker</i> in <i>The Wife</i>. It seems clear that
Cocke and not Stephens wrote the present character, and that
<i>An Excellent Actor</i> was a reply to it. It is true that
Stephens only speaks of it as ‘lenghthened’ by the attack on
himself, but ‘lenghthened’ may mean ‘pieced out’, and there is
no version, long or short, in any of the five first editions of
<i>The Wife</i>, while a reference to ‘the sixt impression of
S. Thomas Overburyes wife’ on p. 434 of B shows this was before
its writers. John Stephens (cf. ch. xxiii) was a Lincoln’s Inn
dramatist. I cannot find a likely Cocke in the <i>Lincoln’s
Inn Admission Books</i>; there is an Isaac Cox, admitted 10
Jan. 1611 (i. 154), and a John Cookes on 6 June 1614 (i. 166).

<h4><i>A common Player</i></h4>

<p><i>Is a slow Payer, seldom a Purchaser, never a Puritan.</i> The
Statute hath done wisely to acknowledg him a Rogue errant<a id="FNanchor_824" href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a>, for
his chiefe essence is, <i>A daily Counterfeit</i><a id="FNanchor_825" href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a>: He hath
beene familiar so long with out-sides, that he professes himselfe
(being unknowne) to be an apparant Gentleman. But his thinne Felt,
and his silke Stockings, or his foule Linnen, and faire Doublet,
doe (in him) bodily reveal the Broker: So beeing not sutable, hee
proves a Motley: his mind observing the same fashion of his body:
both consist of parcells and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span> remnants: but his minde hath commonly
the newer fashion, and the newer stuffe: hee would not else hearken
so passionately after new Tunes, new Trickes, new Devises: These
together apparrell his braine and understanding, whilst he takes the
materialls upon trust, and is himself the Taylor to take measure of
his soules liking. Hee doth conjecture somewhat strongly, but dares
not commend a playes goodnes,<a id="FNanchor_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a> till he hath either spoken, or
heard the <i>Epilogue</i><a id="FNanchor_827" href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a>: neither dares he entitle good things
<i>Good</i>, unlesse hee be heartned on by the multitude: till then
hee saith faintly what hee thinkes, with a willing purpose to recant
or persist: So howsoever hee pretends to have a royall Master or
Mistresse, his wages and dependance prove him to be the servant of the
people.<a id="FNanchor_828" href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a> When he doth hold conference upon the stage; and should
looke directly in his fellows face; hee turnes about his voice into the
assembly for applause-sake, like a Trumpeter in the fields, that shifts
places to get an eccho.<a id="FNanchor_829" href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> The cautions of his judging humor (if hee
dares undertake it) be a certaine number of sawsie rude<a id="FNanchor_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> jests
against the common lawyer; hansome conceits against the fine Courtiers;
delicate quirkes against the rich Cuckold a cittizen; shadowed
glaunce<a id="FNanchor_831" href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a> for good innocent Ladies and Gentlewomen; with a nipping
scoffe for some honest Justice, who hath<a id="FNanchor_832" href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a> imprisoned him: or some
thriftie Trades-man, who hath allowed him no credit: alwayes remembred,
his object is, <i>A new play</i>, or <i>A play newly revived</i>. Other
Poems he admits, as good-fellowes take Tobacco, or ignorant Burgesses
give a voyce, for company sake; as thinges that neither maintaine nor
be against him. To be a player, is to have a <i>mithridate</i> against
the pestilence; for players cannot tarry where the plague raignes; and
therfore they be seldome infected.<a id="FNanchor_833" href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a> He can seeme no lesse then one
in honour, or at least one mounted; for unto miseries which persecute
such, he is most incident. Hence it proceeds, that in the prosperous
fortune of a play frequented, he proves immoderate, and falles into
a Drunkards paradise, till it be <i>last</i> no longer. Otherwise
when adversities come, they come together: For Lent and Shrovetuesday
be not farre asunder, then he is dejected daily and weekely: his
blessings be neither lame nor monstrous; they goe upon foure legges,
but moove slowly, and make as great a distance between their steppes,
as between the foure Tearmes. Reproofe is ill bestowed uppon him; it
cannot alter his conditions: he hath bin so accustomed to the scorne
and laughter of his audience, that hee cannot bee ashamed of himselfe:
for hee dares laugh in the middest of a serious conference, without
blushing.<a id="FNanchor_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a> If hee marries, hee mistakes the Woman for the Boy in
Womans attire, by not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span> respecting a difference in the mischiefe: But so
long as he lives unmarried, hee mistakes the Boy, or a Whore for the
Woman; by courting the first on the stage, or visiting the second at
her devotions. When hee is most commendable, you must confesse there
is no truth in him: for his best action is but an imitation of truth,
and <i>nullum simile est idem</i>. It may be imagined I abuse his
carriage, and hee perhaps may suddenly bee thought faire-conditioned;
for he <i>playes above board</i>.<a id="FNanchor_835" href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a> Take him at the best, he is but
a shifting companion; for hee lives effectually by putting on, and
putting off. If his profession were single, hee would think himselfe a
simple fellow, as hee doth all professions besides his owne: His own
therefore is compounded of all Natures, all humours, all professions.
Hee is politick also<a id="FNanchor_836" href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a> to perceive the commonwealth<a id="FNanchor_837" href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> doubts of
his licence, and therefore in spight of Parliaments or Statutes hee
incorporates himselfe by the title of a brotherhood. Painting and fine
cloths may not by the same reason be called abusive, that players may
not be called rogues: <i>For they bee chiefe ornaments of his Majesties
Revells</i>.<a id="FNanchor_838" href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a> I need not multiplie his character; for boyes and
every one, wil no sooner see men of this Facultie walke along but they
wil (unasked) informe you what hee is by the vulgar title.<a id="FNanchor_839" href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> Yet in
the generall number of them, many may deserve a wise mans commendation:
and therefore did I prefix an Epithite of <i>common</i>, to distinguish
the base and artlesse appendants of our citty companies, which often
times start away into rusticall wanderers and then (like Proteus) start
backe again into the Citty number.<a id="FNanchor_840" href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a></p>


<h3>lxi. 1615. <span class="smcap">John Webster</span> (?).</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[This Character <i>Of an Excellent Actor</i> is one of the
additions made in the 6th edition (1615) to the Characters
printed with Sir Thomas Overbury’s <i>The Wife</i>, of which
the 1st edition appeared after Overbury’s death on 15 Sept.
1613. The Characters do not profess to be all from Overbury’s
hand, and the present one was evidently written as a reply
to that of <i>A Common Player</i> (No. lx). The allusion to
painting suggests that the model was Richard Burbadge. The
passage <i>Therefore the imitating Characterist ... flea
them</i> was omitted in the 7th edition (1616) and in later
editions, including the 9th (1616), from which the reprints in
E. F. Rimbault, <i>Works of Overbury</i>, 147, and H. Morley,
<i>Character Writings</i>, 86, are taken. A. F. Bourgeois, in 11
<i>N. Q.</i> x. 3, 23, gives some striking parallels of phrase
between the Characters of 1615 and the work of John Webster,
which may point to his authorship. Later Characters of a Player
are in J. Earle, <i>Microcosmography</i> (1628, ed. A. S. West,
81), and R. M., <i>Micrologia</i> (1629, Morley, 285).]</p>
</div>


<h4><i>An Excellent Actor.</i></h4>

<p>Whatsoeuer is commendable in the graue Orator, is most exquisitly
perfect in him; for by a full and significant action of body, he
charmes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span> our attention: sit in a full Theater, and you will thinke
you see so many lines drawne from the circumference of so many eares,
whiles the <i>Actor</i> is the <i>Center</i>. He doth not striue to
make nature monstrous, she is often seene in the same Scaene with
him, but neither on Stilts nor Crutches; and for his voice tis not
lower then the prompter, nor lowder then the Foile and Target. By his
action he fortifies morall precepts with example; for what we see him
personate, we thinke truely done before vs: a man of a deepe thought
might apprehend, the Ghosts of our ancient <i>Heroes</i> walk’t againe,
and take him (at seuerall times) for many of them. Hee is much affected
to painting, and tis a question whether that make him an excellent
Plaier, or his playing an exquisite painter. Hee addes grace to the
Poets labours: for what in the Poet is but ditty, in him is both ditty
and musicke. He entertaines vs in the best leasure of our life, that
is betweene meales, the most vnfit time, either for study or bodily
exercise: the flight of Hawkes and chase of wilde beastes, either of
them are delights noble: but some think this sport of men the worthier,
despight all <i>calumny</i>. All men haue beene of his occupation:
and indeed, what hee doth fainedly that doe others essentially: this
day one plaies a Monarch, the next a priuate person. Heere one Acts a
Tyrant, on the morrow an Exile: A Parasite this man to night, to morow
a Precisian, and so of diuers others. I obserue, of all men liuing, a
worthy Actor in one kind is the strongest motiue of affection that can
be: for when he dies, wee cannot be perswaded any man can doe his parts
like him. Therefore the imitating Characterist was extreame idle in
calling them Rogues. His Muse it seemes, with all his loud inuocation,
could not be wak’d to light him a snuffe to read the Statute: for I
would let his malicious ignorance vnderstand, that Rogues are not to
be imploide as maine ornaments to his Maiesties Reuels; but the itch
of bestriding the Presse, or getting vp on this wodden Pacolet, hath
defil’d more innocent paper, then euer did Laxatiue Physicke: yet is
their inuention such tyred stuffe, that like Kentish Posthorse they
can not go beyond their ordinary stage, should you flea them. But to
conclude, I valew a worthy Actor by the corruption of some few of the
quality, as I would doe gold in the oare; I should not mind the drosse,
but the purity of the metall.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[<i>Bibliographical Note.</i>&mdash;The material here collected
relates to the control of the stage both by the central
and, so far as London and its suburbs are concerned, by
the local authorities. It is largely drawn from official
sources, especially the Chancery Rolls and the Privy Council
Register, and the City archives, in particular the series of
<i>Remembrancia</i>, which begins in 1579 and contains copies
of official correspondence between the Corporation and the
Privy Council, or individual persons of honour. Something has
also been contributed by the <i>Repertories</i> of the Court
of Aldermen and the <i>Journals</i> of the Common Council, but
these, as well as the <i>Liber Legum</i> and the <i>Letter
Books</i>, which extend to 1590, probably still require further
search. The nature of the Privy Council Register is described
in ch. ii, and it must be borne in mind that orders relating to
plays are probably missing from it, owing to <i>lacunae</i>, of
which the chief are May 1559–May 1562, Sept. 1562–Nov. 1564,
Dec. 1565–Oct. 1566, May 1567–May 1570, July 1572–Feb. 1573,
June 1582–Feb. 1586, Aug. 1593–Oct. 1595, April 1599–Jan.
1600, Jan. 1602–May 1613. For the last of these an abstract
covering 1602–10 in <i>Addl. MS</i>. 11402 is an inadequate
substitute. Probably some volumes of the Register were burnt
in the fire of 1619 (cf. ch. i). Many of the documents were
printed by Collier, Hazlitt, Wright, and others, but in
most cases more authoritative texts are available in such
publications as the <i>Statutes of the Realm</i> (1810–22),
J. R. Dasent, <i>Acts of the Privy Council</i> (1890–1907),
J. C. Jeaffreson, <i>Middlesex County Records</i> (1888–92),
W. W. Greg, <i>Henslowe Papers</i> (1907), C. C. Stopes,
<i>Extracts from London Play Regulations</i> (1908, Harrison,
<i>Description of England</i>, Part iv), and <i>Collections of
the Malone Society</i>, vol. i (<i>Dramatic Records</i> from the
<i>Remembrancia</i>, <i>Lansdowne Manuscripts</i>, <i>Patent
Rolls</i>, and <i>Privy Council Register 1603–42</i>, by E. K.
Chambers and W. W. Greg), and in view of the diplomatic accuracy
of these I have allowed myself to make the present copies more
readable by means of additional punctuation, modifications
in the use of capitals, and the extension of contractions. I
have also occasionally omitted an irrelevant passage or an
endorsement. And I have replaced full texts by abstracts where,
as in the case of the company patents, the full texts seemed to
go better in other sections of this work.]</p>

<p>My dutie humblie done to your Lp. Where it happened on Sundaie last
that some great disorder was committed at the Theatre, I sent for the
vnder shireue of Middlesex to vnderstand the cercumstances, to the
intent that by my self or by him I might haue caused such redresse to
be had as in dutie and discretion I might, and therefore did also send
for the plaiers to haue apered afore me, and the rather because those
playes doe make assembles of Cittizens and their familes of whome I
haue charge. But forasmuchas I vnderstand that your Lp with other of
hir Maiesties most honorable Counsell haue entered into examination
of that matter, I haue surceassed to procede further, and do humbly
refer the whole to your wisdomes and graue considerations. Howbeit I
haue further thought it my dutie to informe your Lp, and therewith also
to beseche to haue in your honorable remembrance, that the players
of playes, which are vsed at the Theatre, and other such places, and
tumbleres and such like are a very superfluous sort of men, and of
suche facultie as the lawes haue disalowed, and their exersise of those
playes is a great hinderaunce of the seruice of God, who hath with his
mighty hand so lately admonished vs of oure earnest repentance. It
is also great corruption of youthe with vnchast and wicked matters,
occasion of muche incontinence, practises of many ffrayes, querrells,
and other disorders and inconueniences, bisid that the assemble of
terme and parliament being at hand, against which time the most
honorable Lordes haue given vs earnest charge to haue care to auoide
vncleanenesse and pestering of the Citty, the said playes are matter
of great daunger. Therefore I humble beseche your Lp, for those and
other graue considerations that your Lp can better call to mind, it
will please you that some order be taken by commaundement from your
Lp and the rest of the most honorable Lordes that the said playes and

<p>After our hartie comendacons. Whereas heretofore for sundry good
causes and consideracons, as yow know, we haue oftentimes geuen order
for the restraint of plaies, in and about the Citie of London: and
neuerthelesse of late for honest recreation sake, in respecte that her
maiestie sometimes taketh delight in those pastimes, we thought it not
vnfitt, hauing regard vnto the season of the yere and the Clerenes of
the Citie from infection, to allowe of certaine companies of plaiers to
exercise their playeng in London, partly to the ende they might thereby
attaine to the more dexteritie and perfection in that profession,
the better to content her maiestie, whereupon we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span> permitted the said
players to vse their playeng vntill we shold se cause to the contrary,
and foreseing that the same might be done without impeachment of the
seruice of God whereof we haue a speciall care, we restrained them from
playeng on the sabothe daye: and forasmucheas we suppose that their
honest exercise of recreation in playeng, to be vsed on the ordinarie
S. Hollydaies after euening prayer, as long as the season of the yere
may permitt and may be without daunger of the infection, will not be
offensiue, so that if care be had that their comodies and enterludes
be looked into, and that those which do containe mater that may bread
corruption of maners and conuersacion among the people (which we
desire in any case to haue auoided) be forbidden, whereunto we wishe
yow did appointe some fitt persones whoe maie consider and allowe of
suche playes onely as be fitt to yeld honest recreacion and no example
of euell: We haue therefore thought good to pray your Lp. to reuoke
your late inhibition against their playeng on the said hollydaies
after euening prayer, onely forbearing the Sabothe daie whollie
according to our former order. And when yow shall finde that the
continuance of the same their excercise by the increase of the sicknes
and infection shalbe dangerous, we praye your Lp. therin to geue vs
knowlege &amp; thereupon we will presentely take order for their restrainte
accordinglie: Soe fare yowe hartelie well from the Court at Grenewich

<p>My dutie humblie done to your LLps. I haue receaued significacon of
your LLps. pleasure by your letters for enlarging the restrainte of
players on holydaies in the afternone, being not the sabbat daye,
so as the same may be done after seruice and without disturbance of
comon prayer and seruice of God, which as the experience is among vs
peraduenture not made knowen to your LLps. can very hardly be done.
For thoughe they beginne not their playes till after euening prayer,
yet all the time of the afternone before they take in hearers and fill
the place with such as be therby absent from seruing God at Chirch,
and attending to serue Gods enemie in an Inne; If for remedie hereof I
shold also restraine the letting in of the people till after seruice
in the chirche, it wold driue the action of their plaies into very
inconuenient time of night, specially for seruantes and children to
be absent from their parentes and masters attendance and presence:
Howbet the case is of more inconuenience (as I take it) for that the
plag increaseth, and the season extraordinarilie whote and perelous
for this time of yere, and in the opinion of me and my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span> bretheren,
both more mete for the safetie of the Quenes subiectes, and more easy
to be stayed by good and lawfull policie in the beginning then when
it is growen to further spreding of infection, byside that the tearme
being at hand, and the parlament by prorogacon not long after, I haue
thought it dutie to obey your LLps. comaundement in signifieng that
euen now the renewing and continuance of their exersise by the increase
of siknes and infection is daungerous, prayeng your LLps. to take order
for continuing the restrainte accordinglie. As touching the orders
prescribed in your LLps. lettres for the maters and maner of their
playes at such time as yow may hereafter enlarge them, I will according
to your said direction take furder order at all times to restraine
them, till their maters be perused by graue and discrete persones such
as I shall require to take that peine, and till they well asure me to
obey the cautions appointed in your said letters. And so I leaue to

not moued your Lp. by my former lettres nor my man shold not haue

wanteth some part of that good and frendely consideracion, which in

hard exposition in some mens iugement, yet the truthe is that I did
not expulse your seruant from playeng his prise, but for your sake I
did geue him licence. Onely I did restraine him from playeng in an
Inne which was somewhat to close for infection, and appointed him to
playe in an open place of the leaden hall more fre from danger and
more for his Comoditie, which licence I gaue him in open Courte, and
he might well haue vsed it before increace of peril by heate of the
yere. But about xiiijtene daies afterward, when I thought he had taken
the benefitt and effecte of my graunte, the infection growing, whereof
your Lp. knoweth what earnest care I ought to haue, and how seriously
bothe her maiestie and your Lp. with the rest of the most honorable

my dutie, I was indede inforced to restraine him from gathering publik
assemblie of people to his play within the Citie, and neuerthelesse
did allowe him in the open feildes where the peril might not be so
great: But verely my good Lord, whoesoeuer hath Informed yow that I
haue forbidden your man and licenced other to your seruantes disgrace
he doth me great wrong, for I neither haue nor intende so to doe. For

<p>[1582 (?). Extract from <i>Orders Appointed to be Executed
in the Cittie of London for Setting Rogues and Idle Persons
to Worke, and for Releefe of the Poore</i>, printed by Hugh
Singleton (<span class="allsmcap">N.D.</span>). The B.M. copy (796 E. 37) is
catalogued, with the date 1587, as an Act of the Court of
Aldermen. C. Welch, <i>The City Printers</i> (<i>Bibl. Soc.
Trans.</i> xiv. 191), also gives the date as 1587, and says that
Singleton became City Printer on 4 Aug. 1584. Whatever the date
of the print, it seems clear from No. lxxv (2) (<i>a</i>) that
the order itself, or at any rate Art. 62 of it, is later than
the crying of the preachers against plays and earlier than the
Paris Garden accident of 13 Jan. 1583. The autumn of 1582 seems
to me the most likely date. Possibly Art. 62 was alone new.
Aydelotte, 70, says that the Orders which were to enforce 18
Eliz. c. 3 were originally printed in 1579 or 1580, and refers
to <i>Journal</i>, xx, pt. ii, f. 325. Art. 61, and also Art.
25, which directs an inquest for ‘suspect persons which ...
spend their times at bowling allies, playes, and other places
unthriftily’, may belong to the earlier version.]</p>
</div>

<p>Art. 61. For helpe of the hospitals &amp; Parishes in this charge all
churchwardens &amp; collectors for the poore be strayghtly charged to
execute the lawe against such as come not to church, against al persons
without exception, and specially against such as while they ought to
be at diuine seruice, doo spend their time and their money lewdly in
haunting of plaies, and other idle and wycked pastimes and exercises.</p>

<p>Art. 62. For as much as the playing of Enterludes, &amp; the resort to
the same are very daungerous for the infection of the plague, whereby
infinite burdens and losses to the Citty may increase, and are very
hurtfull in corruption of youth with incontinence &amp; lewdnes, and also
great wasting both of the time and thrift of many poore people and
great prouoking of the wrath of God the ground of all plagues, great
withdrawing of the people from publique prayer &amp; from the seruice of
God: and daily cryed out against by the graue and earnest admonitions
of the preachers of the word of God: Therefore be it ordered that all
such Enterludes in publique places, and the resort to the same shall
wholy be prohibited as ungodly, and humble sute be made to the Lords
that lyke prohibition be in places neere unto the Cittie.</p>

of maiesties pleasure to that end with verie greuous charging vs with

and meane to play a prise at the Theatre on Tuesday next, which is
May eue. How manie waies the same maie be inconuenient and dangerous,

willing them at their perill to forbeare their passing both thorough
the citie, and their whole plaieng of such prise. Now bicause yowe know
how much this mater importeth the whole citie, and how from time to

<p>Right honorable and my very good Lo. Vpon Whit Sondaye there was a very
good Sermond preached at the New churche yard nere bethelem, wherat my
Lo. Maiour was with his bretherne, and by reason no playes were the

<p>Vpon Mondaye night I retorned to London and found all the wardes full
of watchers. The cause thereof was for that very nere the Theatre or
Curten at the tyme of the Playes there laye a prentice sleping vpon
the Grasse, and one Challes <i>al.</i> Grostock dyd turne vpon the Too
vpon the belly of the same prentice, whervpon the apprentice start vp
and after wordes they fell to playne bloues; the companie encressed of
bothe sides to the nosmber of v<sup>c</sup> at the least. This Challes exclaimed
and said that he was a gentelman and that the apprentise was but a
Rascall; and some there were litell better then rooges that tooke vpon
theym the name of gentilmen and said the prentizes were but the skomme
of the worlde. Vpon these trobles the prentizes began the next daye,
being Twesdaye, to make mutines and assembles, and dyd conspire to have
broken the presones &amp; to have taken furthe the prentizes that were
imprisoned; but my Lo. and I having intelligens thereof apprensed .iiij.
or.v. of the chieff conspirators, who are in Newgate and stand Indicted
of theire lewd demeanors.</p>

<p>Vpon Weddensdaye one Browne, a serving man in a blew coat, a shifting
fellowe having a perrelous witt of his owne, entending a spoile if
he cold have browght it to passe, did at Theatre doore querell with
certen poore boyes, handicraft prentises, and strook some of theym, and
lastlie he with his sword wondend and maymed one of the boyes vpon the
left hand; where vpon there assembled nere a ml. people. This Browne
dyd very cuninglie convey hym selff awaye, but by chaunse he was taken
after and browght to mr. Humfrey Smithe, and because no man was able to
charge hym he dismissed hym, and after this Browne was browght before
mr. Yonge, where he vsed hym selff so connynglie and subtillie, no man
being there to charge hym, that there also he was demised. And after
I sent a warraunt for hym, and the Constables with the deputie at the
Bell in Holbourne found hym in a parlor fast locked in, and he wold not
obeye the warraunt, but by the meane of the hoost he was conveyed a
waye, and then I sent for the hoost and caused hym to appere at Newgat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
at the Sessions of Oier and determiner, where he was committed vntill
he browght furth his gest. The next daye after he browght hym forthe,
and so we Indicted hym for his misdemeanour. This Browne is a commen
Cossiner, a thieff, &amp; a horse stealer, and colloreth all his doynges
here abowt this towne with a sute that he haithe in the lawe agaynst a
brother of his in Staffordshire. He resteth now in Newgate....</p>

<p>Vpon Weddensdaye, Thursdaye, Frydaye and Satterdaye we dyd nothing els

helpe of my lord Anderson and mr. Sackforthe.</p>

<p>Vpon Sonndaye my Lo. sent ij Aldermen to the Court for the suppressing
and pulling downe of the Theatre and Curten. All the LL. agreed
therevnto, saving my Lord Chamberlen and mr. Viz-chamberlen, but we
obteyned a lettre to suppresse theym all. Vpon the same night I sent
for the quenes players and my Lo. of Arundel his players, and they
all willinglie obeyed the LL. lettres. The chiefestes of her highnes
players advised me to send for the owner of the Theater, who was a
stubburne fellow, and to bynd hym. I dyd so; he sent me word that he
was my Lo. of Hunsdons man, and that he wold not come at me, but he
wold in the mornyng ride to my lord; then I sent the vndershereff for
hym and he browght hym to me; and at his commyng he stowtted me owt
very hastie; and in the end I shewed hym my Lo. his mrs. hand and then
he was more quiet; but to die for it he wold not be bound. And then I
mynding to send hym to prison, he made sute that he might be bound to

<p>[<i>c.</i> 1584, Nov. (1) Petition of the Queen’s Players
to the Privy Council, and (2) Answer of the Corporation of
London enclosing the Act of Common Council of 6 Dec. 1574 (No.
xxxii), printed <i>M. S. C.</i> i. 168, from <i>Lansd. MS.</i>
20, f. 23; also in part by Strype in his edition of Stowe’s
<i>Survey</i> (1720), i. 292; Collier, i. 208; Hazlitt, <i>E.
D. S.</i> 27. The documents are bound up out of order in the
Lansdowne volume, the Act of 1574 being Art. 10 and (1) being
inserted as Art. 12 between the two parts of (2) which are the
reply to it. Each article is officially endorsed in pencil
with the date 1575, and the same date is assigned by the
printed <i>Catalogue of the Lansdowne Manuscripts</i> (1819) to
Arts. 10, 12, and 13. This has misled Collier and nearly all
subsequent historians of the stage into a belief that players
were expelled from the City more or less permanently in 1575,
and that this expulsion led to the building of the Theatre and
the Curtain in 1576. The difficulty due to the description
of the petitioners as the Queen’s men is met by Collier with
a suggestion that ‘perhaps the Earl of Leicester’s servants
might so call themselves after the grant of the patent in May
1574’, and by Fleay, 46, with an assertion that ‘the whole
body of then existing men actors who were going to perform at
Court at Christmas (Warwick’s, Leicester’s, Howard’s)’ were
meant. I called attention to the true bearing of the documents
in a review of T. F. Ordish, <i>Early London Theatres</i> in
the <i>Academy</i> for 24 Aug. 1895, but the misconception<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
still exists; it is found, for instance, in Thompson, 41. The
facts, however, are correctly given in Gildersleeve, 171. It
is clear from that part of the Corporation’s Answer which
Collier suppressed that the real date of the Lansdowne documents
is later than the ‘ruine at Parise garden’, which was on 13
Jan. 1583 (cf. No. lxiv), and it must also be later than the
establishment of the Queen’s men in March 1583, and their first
performances at court in the winter of 1583–4. The petition was,
on the face of it, written at the beginning of a winter, and
the most natural interpretation would place it in the winter of
1584. It might conceivably be 1585. There is no reference to it
in the Acts of the Privy Council, and it probably belongs to the
period of the missing register between June 1582 and Feb. 1586.
Unfortunately, the <i>Remembrancia</i> also have a gap between
March 1584 and Jan. 1587. It will be observed that the Lansdowne
papers are not, as they stand, complete, since they lack the
Articles sent with the players’ Petition, and also the printed
Act of Common Council sent by the Corporation (No. lxiii).
Strype says that the proposed Remedies were adopted, but it is
doubtful whether he had any evidence other than the Lansdowne
MS. itself.]</p>

style="height:1em;  padding:0 0em 0 0em;" />
 directing to the place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span></p>

<p>The first of these actes of Comon counsell was made in the maraltie
of Hawes xvij<sup>o</sup> Regine, and sheweth a maner how plaies were to be
tollerated and vsed, althoughe it were rather wished that they were
wholly discontinued for the causes appearing in the preamble; which is
for that reason somewhat the longer.</p>

<p>Where the players reporte the order to be that they shold not play till
after seruice time, the boke [‘fo. 8<sup>o</sup>’ added in margin] is otherwise;
for it is that they shal not onely not play in seruice time, but also
shal not receue any in seruice time to se the same; for thoughe they
did forbeare beginning to play till seruice were done, yet all the time
of seruice they did take in people; which was the great mischef in
withdrawing the people from seruice.</p>

<p>Afterward when these orders were not obserued, and the lewd maters of
playes encreasced, and in the haunt vnto them were found many dangers,
bothe for religion, state, honestie of manners, vnthriftinesse of the
poore, and danger of infection &amp;c., and the preachers dayly cryeng
against the L. maiour and his bretheren, in an Act of Common Counsel
for releafe of the poore which I send yowe printed, in the Article
62 the last leafe, is enacted as there appeareth, by which there are
no enterludes allowed in London in open spectacle, but in priuate
howses onely at marriages or such like, which may suffise, and sute
is apointed to be made that they may be likewise banished in places
adioyning.</p>

<p>Since that time and namely upon the ruine at Parise garden, sute was

her maiestie such playes as haue ben before commonly played in open
stages before all the basest assemblies in London and Middlesex, and
therfore sufficent for their exercise and more comely for the place
that (as it is permitted by the sayd lawes of common counsell) they
make their exercise of playeng only in priuate houses.</p>

<p>Also it lyeth within the dutiefull care for her Maiesties royal
persone, that they be not suffred, from playeing in the throng of a
multitude and of some infected, to presse so nere to the presence of
her maiestie.</p>

<p class="p-left">Where they pretend the mater of stay of their lyuing:</p>

<p>It hath not ben vsed nor thought meete heretofore that players haue
or shold make their lyuing on the art of playeng, but men for their
lyuings vsing other honest and lawfull artes, or reteyned in honest
seruices, haue by companies learned some enterludes for some encreasce
to their profit by other mens pleasures in vacant time of recreation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span></p>

<p class="p-left">Where in the first article they require the L. Maiors order to continue
for the times of playeing on hollydaies:</p>

<p>They missreport the order. For all those former orders of toleration
are expired by the last printed act of common Counsell.</p>

<p>Also if the toleration were not expired, they do cautelously omitt the
prohibition to receiue any auditoire before common prayer be ended. And
it may be noted how vncomely it is for youth to runne streight from
prayer to playes, from Gods seruice to the Deuells.</p>

<p class="p-left">To the second article.</p>

<p>If in winter the dark do cary inconuenience, and the short time of day
after euening prayer do leaue them no leysure, and fowlenesse of season
do hinder the passage into the feldes to playes, the remedie is ill
conceyued to bring them into London, but the true remedie is to leaue
of that vnnecessarie expense of time, wherunto God himself geueth so
many impediments.</p>

<p class="p-left">To the third.</p>

<p>To play in plagetime is to encreasce the plage by infection: to play
out of plagetime is to draw the plage by offendinges of God vpon
occasion of such playes.</p>

<p>But touching the permission of playes vpon the fewnesse of those that
dye in any weke, it may please you to remember one special thing. In
the report of the plage we report only those that dye, and we make no
report of those that recouer and cary infection about them either in
their sores running or in their garmentes, which sort are the most
dangerous. Now, my Lord, when the number of those that dye groweth
fewest, the number of those that goe abrode with sores is greatest, the
violence of the disease to kill being abated. And therfore while any
plage is, though the number reported of them that dye be small, the
number infectious is so great that playes are not to be permitted.</p>

<p>Also in our report, none are noted as dyeing of the plage except
they haue tokens, but many dye of the plage that haue no tokens, and
sometime fraude of the searchers may deceiue. Therfore it is not reason
to reduce their toleration to any number reported to dye of the plage.
But it is an vncharitable demaund against the safetie of the Quenes
subiectes, and per consequens of her persone, for the gaine of a few,
whoe if they were not her maiesties seruants shold by their profession
be rogues, to esteme fifty a weke so small a number as to be cause of
tolerating the aduenture of infection.</p>

<p>If your Lp. shal think resonable to permit them in respect of the
fewnesse of such as dye, this were a better way. The ordinarie deaths
in London, when there is no plage, is betwene xl. and l. and commonly
vnder xl., as our bokes do shew. The residue or more in plage time is
to be thought to be the plage. Now it may be enough if it be permitted,
that when the whole death of all diseases in London shal by ij or iij
wekes together be vnder l. a weke, they may play (<i>obseruatis alioqui
obseruandis</i>) during such time of death vnder l. a weke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span></p>

<p class="p-left">Where they require that only her maiesties servants be permitted to
play:</p>

<p>It is lesse eiuell than to grannt moe. But herin if your Lp. will so
allow them, it may please you to know that the last yere when such
toleration was of the Quenes players only, all the places of playeing
were filled with men calling themselues the Quenes players. Your
Ls. may do well in your lettres or warrants for their toleration to
expresse the number of the Quenes players and particularly all their
names.</p>


<h4>The remedies.</h4>

<p>That they hold them content with playeing in priuate houses at weddings
etc. without publike assemblies.</p>

<p>If more be thought good to be tolerated: that then they be restrained
to the orders in the act of common Counsell tempore Hawes.</p>

<p>That they play not openly till the whole death in London haue ben by xx
daies under 50 a weke, nor longer than it shal so continue.</p>

<p>That no playes be on the sabbat.</p>

<p>That no playeing be on holydaies but after euening prayer: nor any
receiued into the auditorie till after euening prayer.</p>

<p>That no playeing be in the dark, nor continue any such time but as any
of the auditorie may returne to their dwellings in London before sonne
set, or at least before it be dark.</p>

<p>That the Quenes players only be tolerated, and of them their number and
certaine names to be notified in your Lps. lettres to the L. Maior and
to the Iustices of Middlesex and Surrey. And those her players not to
diuide themselues into seueral companies.</p>

<p>That for breaking any of the orders, their toleration cesse.</p>

assembled themselves by occasion &amp; pretence of their meeting at a play,

Greg, <i>Henslowe Papers</i>, 42, from <i>Dulwich MS.</i> i.
16–18; also in Collier, <i>Alleyn Memoirs</i>, 33–6. I agree
with Greg (cf. Henslowe, ii. 52) that 1592 is a more likely
date than 1593, during the whole of the long vacation of which
plague ruled. We have not the terms of the Surrey inhibition of
23 June 1592 (cf. No. xc), but it may have made an exception for
Newington Butts. If so, the documents can hardly be later than
July, as the plague was increasing by 13 Aug. (Dasent, xxiii.
118). But Greg tacitly assumes that no earlier year than 1592
can be in question, and as against this, cf. vol. i, p. 359.
I think that 1591 is a conceivable alternative, as Strange’s
(q.v.) were probably at the Rose by the spring of that year.
There is no corroborative evidence, indeed, of any inhibition in
1591. But do the documents point to a general inhibition? The
inference from (b) is that houses other than the Rose were open.]</p>

for sportes be forbidden, and therefore doe hereby requier you and
in her Majesty’s name straightlie charge and commande you forthwith
to inhibite within your jurisdiction all plaies, baiting of beares,
bulls, bowling and any other like occasions to assemble any nombers of
people together (preacheing and Devyne service at churches excepted),
wherby no occasions be offred to increase the infection within the
cittie, which you shall doe both by proclamacion to be published to
that ende and by spetiall watche and observacion to be had at the
places where the plaies, beare-baitinges, bowlinges and like pastimes
are usually frequented. And if you shall upon the publicacion finde
any so undutifull and disobedient as they will notwithstanding this
prohibition offer to plaie, beate beares or bulles, bowle, &amp;c., you
shall presentelie cause them to be apprehended and comitted to prison,
there to remaine untill by their order they shalbe dismissed. And
to the end the like assemblies within the out liberties adjoyning
to the cittie [may be prohibited], we have given direction to the
Justices of the Peace and other publique officers of the counties of
Middelsex and Surrey to hold the like course, not onlie within the

<p>1. They are a speaciall cause of corrupting their Youth, conteninge
nothinge but vnchast matters, lascivious devices, shiftes of Coozenage,
&amp; other lewd &amp; vngodly practizes, being so as that they impresse the

the base &amp; refuze sort of people or such young gentlemen as haue small
regard of credit or conscience, drawe the same into imitacion and not
to the avoidinge the like vices which they represent.</p>

<p>2. They are the ordinary places for vagrant persons, Maisterles men,
thieves, horse stealers, whoremongers, Coozeners, Conycatchers,
contrivers of treason, and other idele and daungerous persons to meet
together &amp; to make theire matches to the great displeasure of Almightie
God &amp; the hurt &amp; annoyance of her Maiesties people, which cannot be
prevented nor discovered by the Gouernours of the Citie for that they
are owt of the Citiees iurisdiction.</p>

<p>3. They maintaine idlenes in such persons as haue no vocation &amp; draw
apprentices and other seruantes from theire ordinary workes and all
sortes of people from the resort vnto sermons and other Christian
exercises, to the great hinderance of traides &amp; prophanation of
religion established by her highnes within this Realm.</p>

<p>4. In the time of sicknes it is fownd by experience, that many hauing
sores and yet not hart sicke take occasion hearby to walk abroad &amp; to
recreat themselves by heareinge a play. Whearby others are infected,

<p>A letter to Sir Drew Drewry, knight, William Waad, esquier, Clerke

given to understand by our very good Lord the Lord Willoughby and

Creplegate that there is a purpose and intent in some persons to
erect a theatre in White Crosstreete, neere unto the Barres in that

allreadie not farr from that place, and as you knowe not longe sithence
you receaved spetiall direction to pluck downe those and to see them
defaced, therefore yf this newe erection should be suffered yt would
not onlie be an offence and scandall to divers, but a thinge that would
greatly dysplease her Majestie. These are therefore to will and require
you in any case to take order that no soche theatre or plaiehowse be
built there, or other howse to serve for soche use, both to avoide
the many inconveniences that therby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span> are lyklie to ensue to all the

heretofore given sufficient notice unto you of the great myslyke
her Highnes hath of those publicke and vayne buildinge[s] for soche
occacions that breed increase of base and lewde people and divers other

the Lo: Admirall, the matter, aswell in generalitie touchinge all the
said houses for Stage Plaies and the vse of playenge, as in particuler
concerninge the said house now in hand to be builte in or neere

multitude of the said houses and the misgouerment of them hath bin made
and is dailie occasion of the idle riotous and dissolute livinge of
great numbers of people, that leavinge all such honest and painefull
Course of life, as they should followe, doe meete and assemble there,
and of maine particuler abuses and disorders that doe there vppon

and moderacion be suffered in a well gouerned estate, and that, hir
Maiestie beinge pleased at some times to take delighte and recreacion

meetest in that kinde to yeald hir Maiestie recreacion and delight, &amp;
consequentlie of the howses that must serue for publique playenge to
keepe them in exercise. To the end therefore, that bothe the greatest
abuses of the plaies and plaienge houses maye be redressed, and the
vse and moderacion of them retained, The Lordes and the rest of hir
Maiesties privie Councell, withe one and full Consent, haue ordered in
manner and forme as followeth.</p>

<p>First, that there shall bee about the Cittie two howses and noe more
allowed to serue for the vse of the Common Stage plaies, of the which
howses one shalbe in Surrey in that place which is Commonlie called
the banckside or there aboutes, and the other in Midlesex. And foras
muche as there Lordshippes haue bin enformed by Edmond Tylney Esquire,
hir Maiesties seruant and Master of the Reuells, that the howse now in
hand to be builte by the said Edward Allen is not intended to encrease
the number of the Plaiehowses, but to be in steed of an other, namelie
the Curtaine, Which is either to be ruined and plucked downe or to be
putt to some other good vse, as also that the scituacion thereof is
meete and Conuenient for that purpose. Yt is likewise ordered that the
said howse of Allen shall be allowed to be one of the two howses, and
namelie for the house to be alowed in Middlesex, [for the Companie
of Plaiers belonging to the L: Admirall], soe as the house Called
the Curtaine be (as yt is pretended) either ruinated or applied to
some other good vse. And for the other allowed to be on Surrey side,
whereas [there Lordshipps are pleased to permitt]<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span> to the Companie of
players that shall plaie there to make there owne Choice which they
will haue [of diuers houses that are there], Choosinge one of them and
noe more, [And the said Companie of Plaiers, being the Seruantes of the
L. Chamberlen, that are to plaie there haue made choise of the house
called the Globe, yt is ordered that the said house and none other
shall be there allowed]. And especiallie yt is forbidden that anie
stage plaies shalbe plaied (as sometimes they haue bin) in any Common
Inn for publique assemblie in or neare about the Cittie.</p>

<p>Secondlie, forasmuche as these stage plaies, by the multitude of
houses and Companie of players, haue bin too frequent, not seruing for
recreacion but inviting and Callinge the people daily from there trad
and worke to mispend there time, It is likewise ordered that the two
seuerall Companies of Plaiers assigned vnto the two howses allowed
maie play each of them in there seuerall howse twice a weeke and noe
oftener, and especially that they shall refraine to play on the Sabboth
daie, vppon paine of imprisonment and further penaltie, and that they
shall forbeare altogether in the time of Lent, and likewise at such
time and times as anie extraordinarie sicknes or infeccion of disease
shall appeare to be in and about the Cittie.</p>

<p>Thirdlie, because these orders wilbe of litle force and effecte vnlesse
they be dulie putt in execucion by those to whome yt appertaineth to
see them executed, It is ordered that seuerall Coppies shall be sent
to the L. Mayor of London, and to the Iustices of the Peace of the
Counties of Middlesex and Surrey, and that Lettres should be written
vnto them from there Lordshipps, straightlye Charginge them to see the
execucion of the same, as well by Committinge to prison the owners of
Plaiehouses and players as shall disobey &amp; resist these orders, as by
anie other good and lawfull meanes that in there discretion they shall

they shall se Cause, of there proceedinges therein.</p>

<p>Two letters of one tenour to the Justices of Middlesex and Surrey.
It is in vaine for us to take knowledg of great abuses and disorders
complayned of and to give order for redresse, if our directions finde
no better execution and observation then it seemeth they do, and wee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>

the Justices of the Peace, that are put in trust to see them executed
and perfourmed, whereof wee may give you a plaine instance in the great
abuse contynued or rather encreased in the multitude of plaie howses
and stage plaies in and about the cittie of London.</p>

<p>For whereas about a yeare and a half since (upon knowledge taken of
the great enormities and disorders by the overmuch frequentinge of
plaies) wee did carefullie sett downe and prescribe an order to be
observed concerninge the number of playhowses and the use and exercise
of stage plaies, with lymytacion of tymes and places for the same
(namely that there should be but two howses allowed for that use, one
in Middlesex called the Fortune and the other in Surrey called the
Globe, and the same with observacion of certaine daies and times as in
the said order is particularly expressed), in such sorte as a moderate
practice of them for honest recreation might be contynued, and yet the
inordinate concourse of dissolute and idle people be restrayned, wee do
now understande that our said order hath bin so farr from takinge dew
effect, as in steede of restrainte and redresse of the former disorders
the multitude of play howses is much encreased, and that no daie
passeth over without many stage plaies in one place or other within and
about the cittie publiquelie made.</p>

<p>The default of perfourmance of which our said order we must in greate
parte the rather impute to the Justices of the Peace, because at the
same tyme wee gave earnest direction unto you to see it streightly
executed, and to certifie us of the execution, and yet we have neither
understoode of any redresse made by you, nor receaved any certificate
at all of your proceedinges therein, which default or omission wee
do now pray and require you foorthwith to amende, and to cause our
said former order to be putt duely in execution, and especiallie to
call before you the owners of all the other play howses (excepting
the two howses in Middlesex and Surrey aforementioned), and to take
good and sufficient bondes of them not to exercise, use or practise,
nor to suffer from henceforth to be exercised, used or practized any
stage playinge in their howses, and if they shall refuse to enter into
such bondes, then to comitt them to prison untill they shall conforme
themselves. And so, &amp;c.</p>

<p>A letter to the Lord Maiour and Aldermen of London. Wee have receaved
a letter from you renewing a complaint of the great abuse and disorder

play howses and the inordinate resort and concourse of dissolute

appointed there certaine howses, and one and noe more to each Companie.
Soe we doe straightly require that this third Companie be likewise to

is the place they haue especially vsed and doe best like of, we doe
pray and require yow that that said howse, namely the Bores head, may
be assigned onto them, and that they be verey straightlie Charged to

obtayned lycense vnder the great Seale of Englande for the buildinge
of a Play house haue pulled downe a great Messuage in Puddle wharfe,
which was sometimes the house of the Ladie Sanders within the Precinct

to the great prejudice and inconvenience of the Gouerment of that
Cittie: Their Lordships thought fitt to send for Rosseter to bringe
in his Lettres Patentes, which beinge seene, and pervsed by the Lord
Chief Iustice of Englande fforasmuch as the Inconveniences vrged by the
Lord Mayour and Aldermen were many, and of some consequence to their
Goverment. And specially for that the said Play house would adioyne
soe neere vnto the Church in Blackfryers, as it would disturbe, and
interrupt the Congregacion at divine Service vpon the weeke dayes: And
that the Lord Chiefe Iustice did deliver to their Lordships, That the
Lycence graunted to the said Rosseter did extende to the buildinge of a
Playhouse without the liberties of London, and not within the Cittie.
It was this day ordered by their Lordships, That there shalbe noe
Play house erected in that place, And that the Lord Mayour of London
shall straitly prohibit, and forbidd the said Rosseter and the rest
of the Patentees, and their workemen to proceede in the makeinge, and
convertinge the said Buildinge into a Play house: And if any of the
Patentees or their workemen shall proceede in their intended buildinge
contrary to this their Lordships Inhibicion, that then the Lord Mayour
shall committ him or them soe offendinge, vnto Prison and certefie
their Lordships of their contempt in that behalfe. Of which their
Lordships order the said Rosseter, and the rest are to take notice, and
conforme themselves accordingly as they will aunsweare to the contrary

<p>[<i>Bibliographical Note.</i>&mdash;Early accounts of the vital
statistics of the plague are J. Graunt, <i>Natural and Political
Observations upon the Bills of Mortality</i> (1662, 1665, 1676);
<i>Reflections on the Weekly Bills of Mortality</i> (1665, two
eds.); J. Bell, <i>London’s Remembrancer</i> (1665). Modern
studies are C. Creighton, <i>History of Epidemics in Britain</i>
(1891); C. H. Hull, <i>The Economic Writings of Sir William
Petty</i> (1899, with reprint of Graunt’s <i>Observations</i>);
W. J. Simpson, <i>A Treatise on Plague</i> (1905). Murray, ii.
171, discusses <i>The Relation of the Plague to the Closing
of the Theatres</i>. The ultimate material consists largely
of the weekly bills of mortality returned for each London
parish and published by the City authorities. In these the
deaths from plague were separately stated. They were probably
prepared throughout our period, at any rate from the plague
of 1563. On 14 July 1593 John Wolf entered in the Stationers’
Register (Arber, ii. 634) a licence to print ‘the billes,
briefes, notes and larges gyven out for the sicknes weekly or
otherwise’. The only complete bill extant is one for 20 Oct.
1603 (<i>Political Tracts</i>, 1680, in Guildhall Library),
but summaries of the weekly totals are available for 1563–6
(J. Gairdner, <i>Three Fifteenth-Century Chronicles</i>, 123,
144), 1578–83 (Creighton, i. 341, from <i>Hatfield MSS.</i>),
1593 (Hull, ii. 426, from Graunt; <i>vide infra</i>), 1597–1600
(Hull, ii. 432, from <i>Ashmolean MS.</i> 824), 1603 (Hull, ii.
426, from Graunt; Scaramelli in <i>V. P.</i> x. 33 sqq.), 1604
(Nicolo Molin in <i>V. P.</i> x. 132 sqq.), 1606–10 (Creighton,
i. 494, from Bell). During the sixteenth century the bills
appear normally to have covered 108 or 109 parishes wholly
or partly within the City jurisdiction, but on 4 Aug. 1593
Westminster, St. Katherine’s, St. Giles, Southwark, Shoreditch,
and other suburbs were ordered exceptionally to make returns to
the Lord Mayor (Dasent, xxiv. 442). On 14 July 1603 the normal
list was extended to include eleven suburban parishes, and in
1606 another was added, making 121 in all. But the important
areas of Westminster, Lambeth, Newington, Stepney, Hackney,
Islington, and Rotherhithe remained uncovered. Moreover, the
suburban<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span> figures seem from the print of 1603 to have been
recorded separately, and those in Bell’s pamphlet are shown by a
comparison of his entry for 12 May 1636 with that in Herbert’s
Office-Book (<i>Variorum</i>, iii. 239) to relate only to the
City and liberties. The returns for this area were probably the
basis for play restraints in the seventeenth century (cf. Bk.
ii, ch. x). The bills seem to have been issued on Thursdays,
with figures for the seven days ending on the day of issue.]</p>
</div>

<p>I give all facts indicating any epidemic condition of plague such as
would affect the performance of plays. The play restraints cited are in
App. D.</p>

<p><i>1560.</i> Trinity term was adjourned to Michaelmas on 24 May
(<i>Procl.</i> 525), but plague is not named as the reason.</p>

<p><i>1563.</i> Plague was brought about June by English troops from
Havre. The deaths were above 30 from 3 July to 7 Jan. 1564, and reached
1,828 on 1 Oct. Stowe, <i>Annales</i>, 656, gives the totals as 17,404
from 108 City parishes, and 2,732 from 11 suburban parishes; Camden
(tr.), 83, as 21,130 from 121 parishes. Michaelmas term was adjourned
to Hilary on 21 Sept. (<i>Procl.</i> 582), and Hilary term transferred
to Hertford on 10 Dec. (<i>Procl.</i> 583). Plays were restrained on 30
Sept.</p>

<p><i>1564–6.</i> The bills show no plague deaths over 30.</p>

<p><i>1568.</i> Some precautions were taken in the City and Westminster
against plague (Creighton, i. 318, 338).</p>

<p><i>1569.</i> Further precautions were taken on 27 March (Creighton,
i. 338) and plays restrained on 31 May until 30 Sept. There was in
fact plague in September and October (Creighton, i. 338; La Mothe,
ii. 249, 287; <i>Sp. P.</i> ii. 193, 203). Michaelmas term was
deferred on 28 Sept. (<i>Procl.</i> 642) and adjourned to Hilary on
23 Oct. (<i>Procl.</i> 644). Access to court was restrained on 3 Oct.
(<i>Procl.</i> 643).</p>

<p><i>1570.</i> There was plague in July and August (<i>Hatfield MSS.</i>
i. 476; <i>Sp. P.</i> ii. 262, 270, 273; Creighton, i. 338). Michaelmas
term was deferred on 24 Sept. (<i>Procl.</i> 658).</p>

<p><i>1572.</i> Harrison reports a restraint of plays for fear of plague.
There is no other evidence.</p>

<p><i>1573.</i> Plague appeared in the autumn (Creighton, i. 339). The
Lord Mayor’s feast was suppressed (<i>Remembrancia</i>, 38).</p>

<p><i>1574.</i> Michaelmas term was deferred on 1 Oct. (<i>Procl.</i>
691). The plague deaths on 28 Oct. were 65 (Holinshed, iii. 1240).
The Lord Mayor’s feast was suppressed (Dasent, viii. 303). Plays were
restrained on 15 Nov. until Easter.</p>

<p><i>1575.</i> There was plague in Westminster, but apparently none in
London (Creighton, i. 340). Michaelmas term was deferred on 26 Sept.
(<i>Procl.</i> 696).</p>

<p><i>1576.</i> There was plague in the Tower on 13 July (Dasent, ix.
163). Michaelmas term was deferred on 29 Sept. (<i>Procl.</i> 708).</p>

<p><i>1577.</i> There was plague in August, September, and November
(Dasent, x. 22, 35, 40, 86). Plays were restrained on 1 Aug. to
Michaelmas. Michaelmas term was deferred on 16 Sept. (<i>Procl.</i>
719), and further on 15 Oct. (<i>Procl.</i> 722).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span></p>

<p><i>1578.</i> The plague deaths were over 30 in nearly every week from
17 April to 18 Dec., reaching 280 on 2 Oct., and totalling 3,568 for
the year. The Lord Mayor’s feast was suppressed and the precautions
against infection revised (Dasent, x. 339, 386, 413). Michaelmas term
was deferred on 22 Sept. (<i>Procl.</i> 724) and 20 Oct. (<i>Procl.</i>
725), and adjourned on 14 Nov. to Hilary (<i>Procl.</i> 729). Plays
were restrained on 10 Nov. and the restraint removed on 23 Dec.</p>

<p><i>1579.</i> The plague deaths were below 30 in each week, totalling
629 for the year.</p>

<p><i>1580.</i> The plague deaths were not above 8 in any week, totalling
128 for the year, but plays were restrained from 17 April to
Michaelmas, and other precautions taken (<i>Remembrancia</i>, 329).</p>

<p><i>1581.</i> There was plague in the latter part of the year, with
deaths over 30 from 17 Aug. to 2 Nov., reaching 107 on 5 Oct.,
and totalling 987 for the first forty-five weeks of the year; the
figures for the last seven weeks are missing. The precautions were
revised (Creighton, i. 319). Plays were restrained on 10 July and the
restraint removed on 18 Nov. Michaelmas term was deferred on 21 Sept.
(<i>Procl.</i> 760), and other precautions taken (<i>Remembrancia</i>,
331).</p>

<p><i>1582.</i> There was some plague during the year
(<i>Remembrancia</i>, 332), with deaths over 30 from 26 July to 27
Dec., reaching 216 on 25 Oct., and totalling 2,976 for fifty-one
recorded weeks of the year. Plays were restrained, probably with
the assent of the Privy Council, although the Register is missing.
Michaelmas term was deferred on 18 Sept. (<i>Procl.</i> 764), and
transferred to Hertford on 8 Oct. (<i>Procl.</i> 765).</p>

<p><i>1583.</i> The plague deaths were over 30 from 3 to 31 Jan., after
which the record fails. But precautions continued (<i>Remembrancia</i>,
335). A restraint of plays was terminated on 26 Nov.</p>

<p><i>1584.</i> There is no evidence of plague, but the dispute of this
year suggests that the summer restraint of recent years had been
repeated.</p>

<p><i>1585.</i> There is no evidence of plague or restraint.</p>

<p><i>1586.</i> There is no evidence of plague, other than a precautionary
restraint of 11 May.</p>

<p><i>1587.</i> There was a similar precautionary restraint on 7 May.</p>

<p><i>1588–91.</i> There is no evidence of plague or even of precautionary
restraints.</p>

<p><i>1592.</i> The first notice of plague is on 13 Aug., when it was
daily increasing (Dasent, xxiii. 118), and there is ample evidence of
its seriousness to the end of the year (ibid., 136, 177, 181, 183,
203, 220, 230, 231, 241, 273, 274, 276, 365; Birch, <i>Eliz.</i> i.
87; Creighton, i. 351). A new ‘booke of orders and remedies’ was
recommended by the Council (Dasent, xxiii. 203) on 19 Sept. to the
Kent justices. This is doubtless the <i>Orders Thoughte Meete by her
Maiestie and her privie Counsell to be executed</i> of which several
prints (1592, 1593, 1603, <span class="allsmcap">N.D.</span>) exist. It is for provincial
use, and has no special reference to the restraint of plays. Plays had
been under restraint for other reasons than plague since 23 June. The
mayoral feast was suppressed on 11 Oct. (Dasent, xxiii. 232). Access to
Hampton Court was restrained on 12 Oct. (<i>Procl.</i> 854). Michaelmas
term was deferred and finally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span> transferred for a short session to
Hertford on 21 Oct. (<i>Procl.</i> 852, 855, 856). There appear to be
no statistics of deaths; those ordinarily given belong to 1593 (<i>vide
infra</i>). Suitors were still excluded from court on 13 Dec. (Dasent,
xxiii. 365), but thereafter there was some recovery, and the records in
Henslowe, i. 15, show that plays were permitted from 29 Dec. to 1 Feb.
1593, although no formal order is extant.</p>

<p><i>1593.</i> This was a year of continuous plague (Creighton, i. 352).
The Privy Council warned the Lord Mayor on 21 Jan. that the increase
of deaths after some weeks of diminution required care (Dasent, xxiv.
21), and the Register shows preoccupation with the subject up to
August, when the record fails (ibid., 31, 163, 209, 212, 252, 265,
284, 342, 343, 347, 373, 400, 405, 413, 442, 443, 448, 472). Plays
were restrained on 28 Jan. Trinity term was deferred on 28 May and
Michaelmas term transferred for a short session to St. Albans on 24
Sept. (<i>Procl.</i> 860, 865, 866). Bartholomew Fair (24 Aug.) was
strictly limited (<i>Procl.</i> 863). Access to court at Nonsuch was
restrained on 18 June and at Windsor on 15 Sept. (<i>Procl.</i> 861,
864). The statistics of deaths are puzzling. Stowe, <i>Annales</i>,
766, gives for the period from 29 Dec. 1592 (Friday) to 20 Dec. 1593
(Thursday) 8,598 in all and 5,390 from plague within the walls, and
9,295 in all and 5,385 from plague in the liberties, totalling 17,893
in all and 10,775 from plague. Camden (tr.), 423, gives a corresponding
total of 17,890. A marginal note to the printed bill of 1603 gives for
weeks ending 20 Dec. 1592 (Wednesday) to 23 Dec. 1593 (Sunday) 25,886
in all and 15,003 from plague. Here are two divergent computations
for the same period, one of which deserts the Thursdays, to which we
know that earlier and later weekly bills related. Both are more or
less contemporary records. On the other hand, a series of broadsheets
(cited in Hull, ii. 426), followed by a table appended to Graunt’s
<i>Observations</i> (ibid.), give nearly the same figures (25,886
and, not 15,003, but 11,503) as the totals of weekly figures for the
period from 17 March (Friday) to 22 Dec. (Friday), not of 1593, but
of 1592, and Graunt adopts these figures for March to Dec. 1592 in
the text of his <i>Observations</i> (Hull, ii. 363), while he adopts
17,844 and 10,662, which are approximately Stowe’s figures, for 1593.
As a matter of fact, the weekly figures given do not add up exactly
to 25,886 and 11,503; I make them (as does Hull, ii. 427) 26,407 and
11,106; Creighton, i. 354, makes the larger figure 25,817. Finally,
the anonymous <i>Reflections on the Bills of Mortality</i> (1665) give
25,886 and 11,503 as the totals for 13 March (Tuesday) to 18 Dec.
(Tuesday), not of 1592, but of 1593 again. The authority of these
<i>Reflections</i> is not great, and there is a discrepancy between
the period they take and that taken in the 1603 bill. But I do not see
how the detailed weekly figures of the broadsheets can belong to 1592.
The plague deaths are 3 on 17 March and 31 on 24 March. For the rest
of the year they only fall below 30 on 31 March, 7 April, 5 May, and
finally on 22 Dec. They reach 41 on 28 April, 58 on 26 May, and climb
to 118 on 30 June. There is a big jump to 927 on 7 July; they get to a
maximum of 983 on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span> 4 Aug. and thereafter decline, dropping below 100
from 24 Nov. and ending with 71 on 15 Dec. and 39 on 22 Dec. These
figures cannot apply to 1592, when plague only made its appearance
about August. On the other hand, the figures for 4 Aug. (1,503 and
983) and 29 Sept. (450 and 330) do not tally exactly, although they
do in general effect, with the 1,603 and 1,135 given as ‘the greatest
that came yet’ in Henslowe’s letter of Aug. 1593, or the 1,100 to
1,200 from plague, representing an abatement in two weeks of 435, in
his letter of 28 Sept. (<i>H. P.</i> 37, 40). On the whole, however,
I think that all the figures before us relate to 1593 and not 1592,
and that the ascription of the detailed tables to 1592 is due to the
fact that they begin with 17 March 159–2/3. Graunt similarly (Hull,
ii. 378) quotes 1593 and 1594, where he clearly means 1594 and 1595.
The discrepancies between Stowe and the tables are probably due to
the different number of parishes covered by different computations.
If the larger figures relate to an area wider than that of City and
liberties (cf. the P. C. order of 4 Aug. 1593 cited in the <i>Bibl.
Note</i>), we perhaps get also an answer to the view of Creighton, i.
354, and Hull, ii. 427, that they are neither of 1592 nor 1593, but
altogether spurious as representing an impossibly high rate of general
mortality for sixteenth-century London, even when allowance is made for
the unscientific nature of the ‘plague-tokens’ as a diagnosis and the
consequent increase in plague-time of deaths ascribed to other causes.</p>

<p><i>1594.</i> As in 1592–3, the diminution of plague in December allowed
of a short winter play season. Henslowe, i. 16, records plays from 26
Dec. to 6 Feb. A restraint was ordered on 3 Feb. It was still thought
necessary to inhibit access to court on 21 April (<i>Hatfield MSS.</i>
iv. 514), but the plague deaths for the year were only 421 (Graunt
in Hull, ii. 378; Bell, <i>London’s Remembrancer</i>). Plays began
tentatively in April and May and regularly in June (Henslowe, i. 17).
The systematization of City precautions was under consideration in the
autumn.</p>

<p><i>1595.</i> There were only 29 plague deaths (Graunt, in Hull, ii.
378; Bell, <i>London’s Remembrancer</i>).</p>

<p><i>1596.</i> Plays were restrained for fear of infection on 22 July,
but there is no other evidence of plague.</p>

<p><i>1597–1600.</i> The tables show no plague deaths above 4 in any week.</p>

<p><i>1601–2.</i> There is no evidence of plague.</p>

<p><i>1603.</i> Plague broke out during April (<i>V. P.</i> x. 33).
Precautions were already being taken on 18 April (<i>Remembrancia</i>,
337). Plays had been restrained during the illness of Elizabeth on 19
March and probably not resumed. The terms of the patent to the King’s
men on 19 May imply an existing restraint. The epidemic was a bad
one; for an account of it, cf. Creighton, i. 474, and Dekker, <i>The
Wonderful Year</i> (1603, <i>Works</i>, i. 100). The coronation was
shorn of its entry and other splendours, and speedy resort to the
country enjoined (<i>Procl.</i> 961, 964, 967). Bartholomew and other
fairs were suppressed or put off (<i>Procl.</i> 964, 968). Trinity
term was deferred on 23 June<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span> (<i>Procl.</i> 957) and Michaelmas
term deferred on 16 Sept, and transferred to Winchester on 18 Oct.
(<i>Procl.</i> 970, 973). Stowe, <i>Annales</i>, 857, gives the total
deaths in the City and liberties as 38,244, including 30,578 from
plague. Creighton, i. 478, calculates from the weekly tables that with
the addition of those suburbs for which records are available, these
figures must be increased to 42,945 and 33,347. The report of 60,000
deaths, which Nicolo Molin (<i>V. P.</i> x. 126) found hard to believe,
was obviously an exaggeration. The weekly plague bill for the City and
liberties reached 30 on 26 May, 43 on 9 June, and rose very rapidly
from the end of the month, reaching a maximum of 2,495, with 542 for
the recorded suburbs, on 1 Sept. On 22 Dec. the plague deaths for City,
liberties, and the suburbs henceforward included in the City lists (120
parishes in all) was still 74. Nicolo Molin’s statements on 5 Dec. that
the plague had almost disappeared, and on 15 Dec. that it was never
mentioned (<i>V. P.</i> x. 124, 126), must have been optimistic.</p>

<p><i>1604.</i> Nicolo Molin (<i>V. P.</i> x. 132 sqq.) records the
totals of the bills (probably a week or so late) in despatches from
26 Jan. to 23 Oct. He gives 15 on 26 Jan. and 27 for the City only
on 8 Feb., and thereafter 20 is only reached in a few weeks of May,
August, and September; 30 never. On 23 Oct. there had only been 6 in
the last fortnight, and ‘as that is nothing out of the common, I will
not make any further reports on this subject’ (<i>V. P.</i> x. 190).
A play restraint was removed on 9 April, but the reason given was the
expiration of Lent, and it is not impossible that the theatres may
have been open before Lent, which began on 22 Feb. The warrant of 8
Feb., however, for a special royal subsidy to the King’s men (App. B)
suggests that they were still unable to perform in public on that date.</p>

<p><i>1605.</i> Creighton, i. 493, says there was ‘not much’ plague; but
a letter of 12 Oct. (Winwood, ii. 140) notes a ‘sudden rising of the
sickness to thirty a week’, followed by some abatement, and there was a
restraint of plays for infection on 5 Oct. which was removed on 15 Dec.</p>

<p><i>1606.</i> This was a year of plague. The deaths reached 33 on
10 July and 50 on 17 July, rose to a maximum of 141 on 2 Oct., and
remained, but for one or two weeks, above 40 to 4 Dec. and above 30 to
the end of the year. The total, for 121 parishes, was 2,124. Michaelmas
term was adjourned on 23 Sept. (<i>Procl.</i> 1038) and access to court
restrained on 1 Nov. (<i>Procl.</i> 1039). There is no record of a
specific order for the restraint of plays; possibly it was automatic as
a result of the play-bill.</p>

<p><i>1607.</i> During the first half of the year the plague deaths were
under 30, except for 38 on 1 Jan., 33 on 5 Feb., 30 on 12 March, 33 on
19 March, and 43 on 30 April. They increased in the autumn, passing 30
on 9 July and 40 on 23 July, to a maximum of 177 on 24 Sept. After 19
Nov. they fell below 30. The total for the year was 2,352. As early
as 12 April the City, unjustified as yet by the plague bill, asked
for a restraint of plays. Access to court was restrained on 2 Nov.
(<i>Procl.</i> 1050).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span></p>

<p><i>1608.</i> The plague deaths were under 30 until 28 July, when they
rose to 50; for the rest of the year they were over 40, with a maximum
of 147 on 29 Sept, and a total of 2,262. The King’s men practised
privately for about eight weeks this winter (App. B).</p>

<p><i>1609.</i> The plague of this year, the heaviest since 1603, is
recorded in Dekker’s <i>Work for Armourers</i> (1609, <i>Works</i>,
iv. 96). The deaths were over 30, and, with four exceptions, over 40
up to 30 Nov., with a maximum of 210 on 21 Sept. and a total of 4,240.
Michaelmas term was deferred on 22 Sept. (<i>Procl.</i> 1085). The
King’s men practised privately for six weeks this winter (App. B).</p>

<p><i>1610.</i> The plague deaths were between 30 and 40 on 28 Dec. 1609
and on 4 and 18 Jan. 1610; then under 30 to 28 June, passing 30 on 5
July and 40 on 12 July, and remaining there during most of the rest of
the year, with a maximum of 99 on 30 Aug. and a total of 1,803. They
fell below 40 on 29 Nov. and below 30 on 6 Dec.</p>

<p><i>1611–16.</i> Plague was absent from London (Creighton, i. 496).</p>

<p>Venimus deinde, ad Arcem Regiam, Grönwidge seu Grunwidge, vulgo
dictam.... Postquam hanc arcem ingressi sumus, ex mandato summi
Cubiculariorum Praefecti, quod Dn. Daniel Rogerius impetraverat, in
Cameram Praesentationis, undiquaque tapetis preciosis exornatam,
(Pavimentum vero, uti in Anglia moris est, foeno erat constratum)
quam Regina, quando in sacellum ad preces ire vult, transire solet;
Ad ianuam stabat nobilis quidam vestibus holosericis amictus,
et catena aurea cinctus, qui Comites, Barones, Nobiles et alios
utriusque sexus, Reginam adire cupientes, ad eandem deducebat; (erat
tum forte dies Dominicus, quo Magnates plaerumque Reginam invisere
solent) in Camera, quam dixi, praestolabantur Reginam, Episcopi,
Cantuariensis et Londinensis, Consiliarii, Officiarii, et nobiles
magno numero. Postea cum hora precum instaret, Regina ex suo conclavi
prodiit, tali cum comitatu; Praeibant Nobiles, Barones, Comites, et
Equites Ordinis Periscelidis, omnes splendide vestiti, et capite
detecto; Proxime antecedebant duo, alter qui sceptrum Regni, alter
qui gladium in vagina rubra aureis liliis distincta, reconditum
cuspide sursum versa portabat, inter quos medius procedebat, Magnus
Angliae Cancellarius, sigillum Regni in marsupio holoserico rubro
gerens; Hos sequebatur Regina, aetatis, uti rumor erat, lxv annorum,
magna cum Maiestate, facie oblonga et candida, sed rugosa, oculis
parvis, sed nigris et gratiosis, naso paululum inflexo, labiis
compressis, dentibus fuliginosis (quod vitium ex nimio saccari usu,
Anglos contrahere verisimile est)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span> inaures habens duas margaritis
nobilissimis appensis, crinem fulvum sed factitium; Capiti imposita,
erat parva quaedam corona, quae ex particula auri celeberrimae illius
tabulae Lunaeburgensis, facta esse perhibetur; pectore erat nuda,
quod Virginitatis apud Anglos Nobiles signum est; Nam maritatae sunt
tectae; Collum torques gemmis nobilissimis refertus circumdabat; manus
erant graciles, digiti longiusculi, statura corporis mediocris; in
incessu magnifica, verbis blanda et humanissima; induta forte tum
temporis erat veste serica alba, cuius oram margaritae preciosissimae
fabarum magnitudine decorabant, toga superiniecta ex serico nigro,
cui argentea fila admista, cum cauda longissima, quam Marchionissa
pone sequens a posteriori parte elevatum gestabat; Collare habebat
oblongum, vice catenae, gemmis et auro fulgens; Tum, cum tali in pompa
et magnificentia incederet, nunc cum hoc, mox cum alio loquebatur,
perhumaniter, qui vel legationis vel alterius rei causa eo venerant,
utens nunc materno, nunc Gallico, nunc Italico idiomate; Nam,
praeterquam quod Graece, et Latine eleganter est docta, tenet ultra iam
commemorata idiomata, etiam Hispanicum, Scoticum, et Belgicum; Omnes
illam alloquentes, pedibus flexis id faciunt, quorum aliquos interdum
manu elevare solet; Hos inter forte tum erat, Baro quidam Bohemus,
Gulielmus Slawata nomine, Reginae literas offerens, cui manum dextram,
chirotheca detracta, annulis et lapidibus preciosissimis splendentem
porrexit osculandam, quod maximum insignis clementiae signum est; In
transitu, quocunque faciem vertit, omnes in genua procidunt; Sequebatur
Gynaeceum ex Comitissis, Baronissis, et Nobilibus foeminis, summa
pulchritudine et forma excellentibus constans, et maxima ex parte,
vestimentis albicans; Ab utroque latere comitabantur eam Satellites
nobiles cum hastis deauratis, quorum quinquaginta sunt numero; In
praeambulo Sacelli, quod huic atrio contiguum est, porriguntur ipsi
libelli supplices, quos benignissime accipit, unde tales fiunt
acclamationes; God save the quene Elisabeth, hoc est, Deus salvet
Reginam Elisabetham; Ad quae populo sic ipsa respondet; I thancke you
myn good peupel, id est, Ago tibi gratias popule mi bone; In sacello
habebatur excellens Musica, qua finita una cum precibus, quae vix
ultra dimidiam horam durabant, Regina eadem magnificentia et ordine,
quo antea discesserat, redibat, et ad prandium se conferebat. Interea
vero dum sacris intererat, vidimus illi apparari mensam hac adhibita

essent, eadem omnino cum ceremonia abivere. Venit tandem Virgo quaedam
Comitissa, uti affirmabatur, eximiae pulchritudinis, vestita veste
serica alba, cui erat adiuncta nobilis matrona, cultrum praegustatorium
ferens, quae ter summo cum decore in pedes provoluta,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span> postea ad mensam
accessit, orbes sale et pane abstersit, tanta cum veneratione, ac si
Regina ipsa praesens fuisset; cumque paululum commorata ad mensam
esset, venerunt satellites Regii, omnes capite nudi, sagis rubris
induti, quibus in postica parte erant affixae rosae aureae, singulis
vicibus xxiv missus ferculorum, in patinis argenteis et maxima ex parte
deauratis, adferentes; Ab his nobilis quidam, ordine cibos accepit,
et mensae imposuit; Praegustatrix vero, cuilibet satelliti, ex eadem,
quam ipsemet attulerat, patina, buccellam degustandam praebuit, ne
aliqua veneni subesset suspicio; Dum satellites isti, qui centum
numero procera corporis statura, et omnium robustissimi ex toto
Angliae Regno, ad hoc munus summa cura deliguntur, supradictos cibos
adportarent, erant in Aulae area xii Tubicines, et duo Tympanistae, qui
tubis, buccinis, et tympanis magno sonitu per sesqui horam clangebant;
Caeremoniis autem, modo commemoratis, circa mensam absolutis, aderant
illico virgines aliquot nobiles, quae singulari cum veneratione,
cibos de mensa auferebant, et in interius et secretius Reginae
cubiculum asportabant; Eligere ibi Regina solet quos vult, caeteri pro
Gynaeceo servantur; Prandet et coenat sola paucis astantibus, atque
nullus admittitur, neque peregrinus, neque Regni quoque incola, nisi

<p>[Extract from Sebastiano Serlio’s <i>Architettura</i> (1551),
being the text of ff. 26<sup>v</sup>-31<sup>v</sup> of <i>Il secondo libro di
Perspettiva</i>, which also contain five woodcuts, representing
(<i>A</i>) the <i>profilo</i> or section of a stage (f. 26<sup>v</sup>),
(<i>B</i>) the <i>pianta</i> or ground-plan of the same stage
(f. 27<sup>v</sup>), (<i>C</i>), (<i>D</i>), (<i>E</i>) elevations
of a <i>scena comica</i> (f. 28<sup>v</sup>), <i>scena tragica</i>
(f. 29<sup>v</sup>), and <i>scena satyrica</i> (f. 30). An English
translation, through the ‘Dutch’, of the five books of the
<i>Architettura</i> was published in 1611, having been entered
in the Stationers’ Register by Thomas Snodham on 14 Dec. 1611
(Arber, iii. 473). Each book has a separate imprint, <i>London
Printed for Robert Peake and are to be sold at his shop neere
Holborne conduit, next to the Sunne Tauerne. Anno Dom. 1611</i>.
Each has also a colophon, with slight variants; that of the
fifth book, which alone names the printer, is <i>Here endeth
the fift Booke: And this also is the end of the whole worke
of Sebastian Serlius; Translated out of Italian into Dutch,
and out of Dutch into English, at the charges of Robert Peake.
Printed at London, by Simon Stafford. 1611. B. W.</i> I do not
know whether B. W. conceals the name of a translator. Robert
Peake, who also signs an Epistle to Prince Henry, prefixed to
the first book, was not a stationer, but a serjeant painter
to James. In this translation the <i>Treatise of Scenes</i>
occupies ff. 23<sup>v</sup>-27 of Bk. ii, ch. 3. The title of this book
is <i>The second Booke of Architecture, made by Sebastian
Serly, entreating of Perspectiue, which is, Inspection, or
looking into, by shortening of the sight</i>. The woodcuts are
reproduced, with some modifications, especially in details of
heraldic decoration.]</p>

<p>[f. 26<sup>v</sup>] Per che ne la seguente carta io trattaro delle Scene e de
Theatri che a nostri tempi si costumano, onde sara difficile a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
comprendere doue et come si debbia porre l’ orizonte delle scene, per
essere diuerso modo dalle regole passate, ho voluto far prima questo
profilo, accio che la pianta in sieme col profilo l’ un per l’ altro si
possino intendere; ma sara perho bene a studiare prima su la pianta, et
se quelle cose non si intenderanno ne la pianta, recorrere al profilo
doue meglio s’ intendera. Primieramente donque io cominciaro dal suolo
dauanti: loquale sara a l’ altezza de l’ occhio et voglio que sia
piano et e segnato <span class="allsmcap">C</span>, et da <span class="allsmcap">B</span> fin a l’ <span class="allsmcap">A</span>
sara lo suolo leuato dalla parte de <span class="allsmcap">A</span> la nona parte; et quel
diritto piu grosso sopra del qual e <span class="allsmcap">M</span> dinota lo muro nel capo
della sala. Quel diritto piu sottile doue e <span class="allsmcap">P</span> sara lo pariete
della scena cioe l’ ultimo. Il termine doue e l’ <span class="allsmcap">O</span> e l’
orizonte. La linea di punti che viene ad essere aliuello da <span class="allsmcap">L</span>
a <span class="allsmcap">O</span> doue essa finira nel pariete vltimo della scena, iui sara
l’ orizonte, loqual pero seruira solamente per quel pariete, et questa
linea sara quella che sara sempre orizonte, alle faccie de i casamenti
che saranno in maiesta. Ma quelle parti de i casamenti che scurtiano
lo suo orizonte sara quel piu lontano segnato <span class="allsmcap">O</span>. Et e ben
ragione se i casamenti in effetto han dua facie, lequai spettino a dua
lati, che anchora habbino dua orizonti; et questo e quanto al profilo
della scena. Ma lo proscenio si e quella segnata <span class="allsmcap">D</span>: la parte
<span class="allsmcap">E</span> rappresenta l’ horchestra leuata da terra mezzo piede. Doue
si vede <span class="allsmcap">F</span> sonno le sedie de piu nobili. Li primi gradi segnati
<span class="allsmcap">G</span> saran per le donne piu nobili, et salendo piu ad alto le
men nobili vi si metterano. Quel luoco piu spacioso doue e <span class="allsmcap">H</span>
e vna strada, et cosi la parte <span class="allsmcap">I</span> vn altra strada onde fra l’
una e l’ altra quei gradi saranno per la nobilita de gli huomini. Dal
<span class="allsmcap">I</span> in su li gradi che vi sonno, li men nobili si metteranno.
Quel gran spacio segnato <span class="allsmcap">K</span> sara per la plebe, et sara magiore
et minore secondo la grandezza del luoco; et lo Theatro, et la scena
ch’ io feci in Vicenza, furono circa a questo modo, et de l’ un corno
a l’ altro del Theatro era da piedi ottanta, per essere questo fatto
in vn gran cortile, doue trouai magior spacio, che doue era la scena
per essere quella appoggiata ad vna loggia. Li armamenti et ligature de
i legnami furono nel modo dimostrato qui auanti, et per esser questo
Theatro senza appoggio alcuno, io volsi (per magior fortezza) farlo
ascarpa nella circonferentia di fori.</p>

<h4><i>Trattato sopra le Scene.</i></h4>

<p>[f. 27] Fra l’ altre cose fatte per mano de gli huomini che si
possono mirare con gran contentezza d’ occhio et satisfationi d’
animo: e (al parer mio) il discoprirsi lo apparato di vna scena, doue
si vede in picol spacio fatto da l’ arte della Perspettiua superbi
palazzi, amplissimi tempij, diuersi casamenti, et da presso, e di
lontano, spaciose piazze ornate di varii edificij, dritissime e longhe
strade incrociate da altre vie, archi triomphali, altissime colonne,
pyramide, obelischi, et mille altre cose belle, ornate d’ infiniti
lumi, grandi, mezzani, et piccoli, secondo che l’ altre lo comporta,
liquali sono cosi arteficiosamente ordinati, che rappresentano tante
gioie lucidissime, come saria Diamanti, Rubini, Zafiri, Smeraldi, et
cose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span> simili. Quiui si vede la cornuta et lucida Luna leuarsi pian
piano; et essersi inalzata, che gli occhi de i spettatori non l’ han
veduta muouersi: in alcune altre si vede lo leuare del sole, et il suo
girare, et nel finire della comedia tramontar poi con tale artificio
che molti spettatori di tal cosa stupiscono; con l’ artificio a qualche
bon proposito si vedera descendere alcun Dio dal cielo, correre
qualche Pianeta per l’ aria, venir poi su la scena diuersi intermedij
richissimamente ornati, liuree di varie sorti con habiti strani, si per
moresche come per musiche. Tal’ hor si vede strani animali entro de i
quali son huomini, et fanciulli, atteggiando, saltando, et correndo
cosi bene, che non e senza merauiglia de riguardanti, le quai tutte
cose dan tanto di contentezza a l’ hocchio, et a l’ animo, che cosa
materiale, fatta da l’ arte, non si potria imaginare piu bella; et di
quelle cose poi che siamo in proposito de l’ arte della perspettiua,
io ne trattaro alquanto. Pure quantunque questo modo di perspettiua
di ch’ io parlaro sia diuerso dalle regole passate, per essere quelle
imaginate sopra li parieti piani: et questa per essere materiale et
di rilieuo e ben ragione a tenere altra strada. Primieramente per il
commune vso si fa vn suolo leuato da terra quanto l’ hocchio nostro;
cioe dalla parte dauanti et di dietro si fa piu alto la nona parte,
partendo in noue parti tutto il piano, et vna di quelle. Sia leuato
il detto suolo dalla parte di drieto verso l’ orizonte, et sia ben
piano et forte per causa delle moresche. Questa pendentia io l’ ho
trouata commoda con la esperientia, perche in Vicenza (citta molto
ricca et pomposissima fra l’ altre d’ Italia) io feci vno Theatro, et
vna scena di legname, perauentura, anzi senza dubio, la magiore che
a nostri tempi si sia fatta, doue per li merauigliosi intermedij che
vi accadeuano, cioe carette, Elefanti, et diuerse moresche, io volsi
che dauanti la scena pendente vi fosse vn suolo piano, la latitudine
del quale fu piede xij, et in longitudine piedi lx, doue io trouai tal
cosa ben commoda, et di grande aspetto. Questo primo suolo essendo
piano, lo suo pauimento non vbidiua a l’ orizonte, ma li suoi quadri
furono perfetti, et al cominciare dal piano pendente tutti quei quadri
andauano a l’ orizonte ilche con la sua debita distantia sminui. Et
perche alcuni han posto l’ orizonte a l’ ultimo pariete che termina la
scena, il qual e necessario metterlo sul proprio suolo al nascimento
di esso pariete, doue dimostra che tutti li casamenti se adunano, io
mi sono imaginato di trapassare piu la con l’ orizonte, la qual cosa
mi e cosi bene reuscita, che a fare tal cose ho sempre tenuto questa
strada, et cosi consiglio coloro che di tal arte se diletterano, a
tener questo camino, como nella seguente carta dimostraro, et come ne
ho trattato qui adietro nel profilo del Theatro, et della Scena. Et
perche gli apparati delle comedie sono di tre maniere, cioe la Comica,
la Tragica, et la Satyrica, io trattaro al presente de la comica, i
casamenti della quale voglion essere di personagi priuati, liquali
apparati per la maggior parte si fanno al coperto in qualche sala, che
nel capo di essa vi sia camere per la commodita de i dicitori, et iui
si fa lo suolo come qui piu a dietro io dissi, e ne dimostrai lo suo
profilo, et qui alianti dimostrero la pianta. Primieramente la parte
<span class="allsmcap">C</span> e quel suolo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span> piano et poniam caso che vn quadro sia dua
piedi, et medesimamente quegli del piano pendente son dua piedi per
ogni lato, et e segnato <span class="allsmcap">B</span>; e (come ho detto nel profilo) io
non intendo di mettere l’ orizonte al pariete vltimo de la scena, ma
quanto sara dal principio di esso piano <span class="allsmcap">B</span> fin al muro sia
trapassato altro tanto di la dal muro con l’ orizonte; et quelle dua
linee di punti dinotano lo muro in capo di essa sala, e cosi tutti
li casamenti et altre cose haueranno piu dolcezza ne i scurcij, doue
tirati tutti li quadri ad esso orizonte, et diminuiti secondo la sua
distantia, si leuaran su li casamenti, li quali son quelle linee grosse
sul piano, per diritto, et per trauerso; et questi tai casamenti io li
ho sempre fatti di telari, sopra liquali ho poi tirato tele, facendogli
le sue porte in faccia et in scurtio secondo le occasioni, et ancho
ci ho fatto alcune cose di basso rilieuo di legnami che han aiutato
molto le pitture, come al suo loco ne trattaro. Tutto lo spacio da
li telari al muro segnati <span class="allsmcap">A</span> seruiranno per li dicittori, et
sempre lo pariete vltimo vuol essere discosto dal muro almen dua piedi,
accio li diccitori possino passar coperti; dipoi quanto si trouera
alto l’ orizonte, sia tanto alzato vn termino al principio del piano
<span class="allsmcap">B</span> che sara <span class="allsmcap">L</span> et da li a l’ orizonte sia tirata vna
linea chi e di punti, laquale sara al liuello, et doue questa ferira
nel vltimo pariete: iui sara l’ orizonte di esso pariete: et non
seruira perho ad altro telaro: ma la detta linea sia vna cosa stabile,
perche questa seruira a tutti quei telari che saranno in maiesta, per
trouare le grossezze di alcune cose, ma lo primo orizonte di la dal
muro seruira a tutti li scurcij de i casamenti. Et perche a far questo
saria necessario a rompere esso muro, ilche non si puo fare, io ho
sempre fatto vno modello piccolo di cartoni et legnami, ben misurato
et traportato poi in grande di cosa in cosa giustamente con facilita.
Ma questa lettione forsi ad alcuno sara difficile, nondimeno sara
necessario faticarsi nel far de modelli et esperientie, che studiando
trouara la via. Et perche le sale (per grande che siano) non son
capaci di Theatri, io nondimeno, per accostarmi quanto io possi agli
antichi, ho voluto di esso Theatro farne quella parte che in vna gran
sala possi capere. Perho la parte <span class="allsmcap">D</span> seruira per proscenio. La

<h4><i>Della Scena Comica.</i></h4>

<p>[f. 28] Quanto alla dispositione de i Theatri, et delle Scene circa
alla pianta io ne ho trattato qui adietro, hora delle scene in
perspettiua ne trattaro particularmente, et perche (com’ io dissi) le
scene si fanno di tre sorte, cioe la Comica per rappresentar comedie,
la Tragica per le tragedie, e la Satyrica per le satyre, questa prima
sara la Comica, i casamenti della quale vogliono essere di personaggi
privati, come saria di cittadini auocati, mercanti, parasiti, et altre
simili persone. Ma sopra il tutto che non vi manchi la casa della
Rufiana ne sia senza hostaria, et uno tempio vi e molto necessario.
Per disporre li casamenti sopra il piano detto suolo, io ne ho dato il
modo piu adietro, si nel leuare i casamenti sopra li piani, come nella
pianta delle scene massime, come et doue si dee porre l’ orizonte.
Nientedimeno accio che l’ huomo sia meglio instrutto circa alle forme
de i casamenti, io ne dimostro qui a lato vna figura, laquale potra
essere vn poco di luce a chi di tal cosa vorra dilettarsi. Pur in
questa essendo cosi picola non ho potuto osseruare tutte le misure.
Ma<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span> solamente ho accennato alla inuentione per aduertir l’ huomo a
saper fare elettione di quei casamenti che posti in opera habbino a
reuscir bene come saria un portico traforato, dietro del quale si vegga
vn altro casamento come questo primo, li archi delquale son di opera
moderna. Li poggiuoli (altri dicono pergoli; altri Renghiere) hanno
gran forza nelle faccie che scurzano, et cosi qualche cornice che li
suoi finimenti vengono fuori del suo cantonale, tagliati intorno et
accompagnati con l’ altre cornice dipinte, fanno grande effetto; cosi
le case che han gran sporto in fuori riusciscono bene, come l’ hostaria
della luna qui presente; et sopra tutte le altre cose si de fare
elettione delle case piu piccole, et metterle dauanti, accio che sopra
esse si scuoprano altri edificii, come si vede sopra la casa della
Ruffiana, l’ insegna della quale sono li rampini, o vogliam dire hami,
onde per tal superiorita della casa piu adietro viene a rappresentar
grandezza, et riempisse meglio la parte della scena, che non farebbe
diminuendo, se le summita delle case diminuissero l’ una dopo altra; et
benche le cose qui disegnate habbino vn lume solo da vn lato, nondimeno
tornano meglio a dargli il lume nel mezzo: percioche la forza de i lumi
si mette nel mezzo, pendenti sopra la scena, et tutti quei tondi, o
quadri, che si veggono per gli edificii sono tutti i lumi artificiati
di varii colori transparenti: de i quali daro il modo da fargli ne l’
estremo di questo libro. Le finestre che sono in faccia sara bene a
mettergli de lumi di dietro, ma che siano di vetro, et ancho di carta
ouero di tela dipinta torneran bene. Ma s’ io volessi scriuere di tutti
gli aduertimenti che mi abbundano circa a tal cose, io sarei forsi
tenuto prolisso, perho io le lassaro nel’ intelletto di coloro che in
tal cose si voranno essercitare.</p>

  </div>


<h4><i>Della Scena Tragica.</i></h4>

<p>[f. 29] La Scena Tragica sara per rappresentare tragedie. Li casamenti
d’ essa vogliono essere di grandi personagi; percioche gli accidenti
amorosi, et casi inopinati, morte violenti et crudeli (per quanto si
lege nelle tragedie antiche, et ancho nelle moderne) sonno sempre
interuenute dentro le case de signori, duchi, o gran principi, imo, di
Re; et perho (come ho detto) in cotali apparati non si fara edificio
che non habbia del nobile: si come se dimostra nella seguente figura,
entro la quale (per esser cosa piccola) non ho potuto dimostrare
quei grandi edificij Regij et signorili, che in vn luogo spatioso
si potrebbono fare. Ma basti solamente a l’ Arcitetto che in torno
a cose simili si vorra essercitare, per hauer vn poco di luce circa
alla inuentione, et dipoi secondo li luochi et anchora li sugietti
sapersi accommodare; et (come ho detto nella scena comica) sempre si
de fare elettione di quelle cose che tornano meglio a riguardanti,
non hauendo rispetto a mettere vn edificio piccolo dauanti ad vno
grande, per le gia dette ragioni. Et perche tutte le mie scene ho
fatte sopra li telari, ci sonno tal volta alcune difficulta, che e ben
necessario a seruirsi del rilieuo di legname, come quello edificio
al lato sinistro, li pilastri del quale posano sopra vn basamento
con alcuni gradi. In questo caso sara da fare il detto basamento di
basso rilieuo, leuato sopra lo piano, et poi si faran li due telari,
cioe quello in faccia, et<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span> quello in scurtio; et stano solamente fin
alla summita del parapetto, che e sopra li primi archi. Hora perche
gli archi secondi se ritirano per dar luoco al parapetto, cosi li dua
telari di sopra si ritiraranno: di maniera che tal opera verra bene, et
quello ch’ io dico di questo edificio se intende anchora de gli altri,
quando qualche parti si ritireranno, massimamente di quei casamenti
che sono qua dauanti. Ma quando tai cose fussero di lontano, vn telaro
solo seruiria, facendo tutte le parti ben lineate, et ben colorite.
Circa alli lumi artificiati, s’ e detto a bastanza nella scena comica.
Tutte le superficie sopra li tetti, come saria camini, campanili, et
cose simili (benché quiui non vi siano) se faranno sopra vna tauola
sottile, tagliati intorno, ben lineati et coloriti. Similmente qualche
statue finte di marmo o di bronzo si faranno di grosso cartone, o
pur di tauola sottile, ben ombregiate et tagliate intorno; poi si
metteranno alli suoi luochi, ma siano talmente disposti, et lontani che
i spettatori non le possino vedere per fianco. In queste Scene, benche
alcuni hanno dipinto qualche personagi che rappresentano il viuo, come
saria vna femina ad vn balcone, o drento d’ una porta, etiamdio qualche
animale,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span> queste cose non consiglio che si faccino, perche non hanno
il moto et pure rappresentano il viuo; ma qualche persona che dorma a
bon proposito, ouero qualche cane o altro animale che dorma, perche non
hanno il moto. Anchora si possono accomodare qualche statue, o altre
cose finte di marmo, o d’ altra materia, o alcuna hystoria, o fabula
dipinta sopra vn pariete, che io lodaro sempre si faccia cosi. Ma nel
rappresentare cose viue lequali habbino il moto, ne l’ estremo di
questo libro ne trattaro, et daro il modo come s’ abbino a fare.</p>

     <p class="p0 sm center">ELEVATION OF A <i>SCENA SATYRICA</i></p>
  </div>


<h4><i>Della Scena Satyrica.</i></h4>

<p>[f. 30] La Scena Satyrica e per rappresentar satyre, nelle quali se
riprendono (anzi vero se mordeno) tutti coloro che licentiosamente
viuono, et senza rispetto nelle satyre antiche erano quasi mostrati
a dito gli huomini viciosi et mal viuenti. Perho tal licentia si
puo comprendere che fusse concessa a personaggi che senza rispetto
parlassero, come saria a dire gente rustica, percioche Vitruuio
trattando delle scene, vuole che questa sia ornata di arbori, sassi,
colli,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span> montagne, herbe, fiori, et fontane, vuole anchora che vi
siano alcune capanne alla rustica, come qui appresso se dimostra. Et
perche a tempi nostri queste cose per il piu delle volte si fanno
la inuernata, doue pochi arbori et herbe con fiori se ritrouano, si
potran bene artificiosamente fare cose simili di seta lequali saranno
anchora piu lodate che le naturali; percioche, cosi come nelle Scene
Comiche et Tragiche se imitano li casamenti et altri edificij, con
l’ artificio della pittura, cosi anchora in questa si potran bene
imitare gli arbori et l’ herbe co fiori. Et queste cose quanto saranno
di maggior spesa tanto piu lodeuoli saranno, perche (nel vero) son
proprie di generosi magnanimi, et richi signori, nemici della bruta
Auaritia. Questo gia vidiro gli occhi mei in alcune scene ordinate da
l’ intendente Architetto Girolamo Genga, ad instantia del suo padrone
Francesco Maria Duca di Vrbino, doue io compresi tanta liberalita nel
prence, tanto giuditio et arte l’ Arcitetto, et tanta bellezza nelle
cose strutte, quanto in altra opera fatta da l’ arte che da me sia
stata veduta giamai. (O Dio immortale) che magnificentia era quella di
veder tanti arbori et frutti, tante herbe et fiori diuersi, tutte cose
fatte di finissima seta di variati colori, le ripe et i sassi copiosi
de diuerse conche marine, di limache et altri animaletti, di tronchi
di coralli di piu colori, di matre perle, et di granchi marini inserti
ne i sassi, con tanta diuersita di cose belle; che a volerle scriuere
tutte, io sarei troppo longo in questa parte. Io non diro de i satyri,
delle Nymphe, delle syrene, et diuersi monstri o animali strani, fatti
con tal artificio, che aconzi sopra gli huomini et fanciulli secondo la
grandezza loro, et quelli, andando et mouendosi secondo la sua natura,
rappresentauano essi animali viui. Et se non ch’ io sarei troppo
prolisso, io narrarei gli habiti superbi di alcuni pastori, fatti di
ricchi drappi d’ oro et di seta, foderati di finissime pelle d’ animali
seluatichi. Direi anchora de i vestimenti d’ alcuni pescatori, liquali
non furono men ricchi de gli altri, le rete de i quali erano di fila
d’ oro fino, et altri suoi stromenti tutti dorati. Direi di alcune
pastorelle et Nymphe, gli habiti delle quali sprezauano l’ Auaritia.
Ma io lassaro tutte queste cose ne gli intelletti de i giudiciosi
Architetti: liquali faranno sempre di queste cose, quando trouaranno
simili padroni conformi alle lor voglie, gli et donanti piena licentia,
con larga mano, di operare tutto quello che vorranno.</p>


<h4><i>Di Lumi arteficiali delle Scene.</i></h4>

<p>[f. 31] Ho promesso piu adietro negli trattati delle scene, di dare il
modo come si fanno i lumi artificiali di variati colori transparenti;
perche primieramente diro del colore celeste, il quale rappresenta il
zafiro et ancho assai piu bello. Prendi vn pezzo di sale ammoniaco, et
habbi vn bacile da barbiere o altro vaso di ottone, mettendogli drento
vn detto di aqua. Poi questo pezzo di sale va ben fregando nel fondo,
et intorno questo bacile, tanto che ’l se consumi tutto: agiungendoli
de l’ aqua tuttauia, et quando vorrai piu quantita di questa aqua,
et che ’l colore sia piu bello, fa maggiore la quantita del sale
ammoniaco. Fatto adonque vno bacile pieno di questa aqua falla passare
per il feltro in vno altro vaso, et questa sara di color<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span> celeste
bellissimo. Ma volendolo piu chiaro vi agiungerai de l’ aqua pura,
cosi di questo sol colore ne farai di molti piu chiari et piu scuri
quanto vorrai; et se di questa medesima aqua zafrina vorrai fare colore
di Smeraldo, mettili drento alquanto di zaffarano, tanto piu o meno,
secondo che la vorrai piu oscura o piu chiara. Di queste cose non ti do
le proportioni; ma con la esperientia ne farai di piu forte o chiare
o pur oscure. Se vorrai fare del colore di Rubino, se sarai in luoco
doue siano vini vermigli carichi di colore et chiaretti: questi faranno
di rubin maturi et gai cioe acerbi, et se non hauerai de vini, prendi
del vergine tagliato in pezzeti, mettendolo in vna caldara piena d’
aqua, con alquanto di alume di rocha, et la farai bolire spiumandola,
et poi passare pel feltro, et agiungendoli aqua pura se vorrai colore
piu chiaro; et se vorai colore di Balasso, il vino goro, bianco, et
vermiglio insieme, fara tal colore. Cosi anchora li vini bianchi piu
et meno carichi faran colore de Griso passo, et di Thopasso. Ma (senza
dubio alcuno) l’ aqua pura passata pel feltro contrafara li Diamanti.
Pure, per farli, sara necessario adoperare alcune forme in punta, et
in tauola, et alla fornace de i vetri fare delle bozze che prendano
tal forma, et quelle impire d’ aqua. Ma il modo de disporre questi
colori transparenti sara questo. Sara di dietro alle cose dipinte,
doue anderanno questi colori, vna tauola sottile traforata nel modo
che saran compartiti questi lumi, sotto laquale sara un’ altra tauola
per sostenere le bozze di vetro piene di queste aque; poi dette bozze
si metteranno con la parte piu curua appoggiate a quei buchi, et bene
assicurate che non caschino per i strepiti delle moresche; et dietro le
bozze si mettera vno cesendelo, overo lampada, accio lo lume sia sempre
equale; et selle bozze verso la lampada saranno piane anzi concaue,
riceueranno meglio la luce, et li colori saranno piu transparenti,
cosi anchora per quei tondi liquali saranno in scurtio sara da fare
le bozze di quella sorte. Ma se accadra tal fiata vn lume grande et
gagliardo, sara da metterui di dietro vna torza, dopo laquale sia vn
bacile da barbiere ben lucido et nuovo, la reflettione del quale fara
certi splendori, come di raggi del sole. Et se alcuni luochi saranno
quadri come mandola, o altre forme, si prendera delle piastre di vetri
di variati colori posti a quei luochi col suo lume di dietro. Ma questi
lumi non saran (perho) quelli che allumineranno la scena, percioche
gran coppia di torze si metteno pendente dauanti alla scena. Si potra
anchora su per la scena mettere alcuni candelieri con torze sopra, ed
anchora sopra essi candelieri vi sia vn vaso pieno di acqua, drento
laquale metterai vn pezzo di camphora, loquale ardendo fa bellissimo
lume, et e odorifero. Alcuna fiata accadera a dimostrare qualche cosa
che abbruscia (sia che si voglia); si bagnara benissimo di aqua vite
della piu potente, et apizatogli lo fuoco con vna candeletta: ardera
per vn pezzo. Et ben che quanto alli fuochi si potra dire assai piu,
voglio questo sia basteuole per presente. Ma parliamo di alcune cose
lequali sono di gran diletto a spettatori. Mentre la scena e vota
de dicitori, potra l’ Arcitetto hauer preparato alcune ordinanze
di figurette, di quella grandezza che si ricercara dove hauranno a
passare, et queste saranno<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span> di grosso cartone colorite et tagliate
intorno, lequali posaranno sopra vn regolo di legno a trauerso la
scena, doue sia qualche arco, fatto sopra il suolo vno incastro a
coda di Rondina, entro lo quale si mettera detto regolo; et cosi
pianamente vna persona dietro al detto arco le fara passare, et tal
fiata dimostrare che siano musici con istrumenti et voci, onde dietro
alla scena sara vna musica a somissa voce. Tal volta fara correre vn
squadrone di gente chi a piedi et chi a cauallo, lequali con alcune
voci o gridi sordi, strepiti di tamburi, et suono di trombe, pascono
molto gli spettatori. Et se tal volta accadera che vno Pianeta, o altra
cosa per aria si vegga passare, sia ben dipinta quella cosa in cartone
et tagliata intorno; poi dietro la scena (cioe a gli vltimi casamenti)
sia tirato a trauerso vn filo di ferro sottile, et con alcuni aneletti
in esso filo attacati dietro il cartone, nel quale sia un filo negro,
et da l’ altro lato sara vna persona che pian piano lo tirara a se,
ma sara di forte lontano, che ne l’ uno ne l’ altro filo sara veduto.
Tal fiata accadera tuoni, lampi et folgori a qualche proposito; li
tuoni cosi si faranno. Sempre (come ho detto) le scene si fanno nel
capo di vna sala, sopra laquale gli e sempre vn suolo, sopra del
quale si fara correre vna grossa balla di pietra, laquale fara bene
il tuono. Lo lampo cosi si fara. Sara vno dietro alla scena in luoco
alto, hauendo nella mano vna scatoletta, entro laquale vi sia polue di
vernice: et il coperchio sia pieno di busi: nel mezzo del coperchio
sara vna candeletta accesa: et alzando in su la mano, quella polue
salira in alto, et perchuotera nella candela accesa, di maniera che
fara lampi assai bene. Circo al folgore, sara tirato vn filo di ferro
lontano a trauerso la scena, che descenda a basso, entro del quale
sara aconcio vn rochetto, o raggio, che si sia, ma questo sara ornato
di oro stridente, et mentre si fara lo tuono, nel finir di quello sia
scaricata vna coda, et nel medesimo tempo dato il fuoco al folgore, et
fara buono effetto. Ma s’ io volessi trattare di quante cose similimi
abbondano, io saria troppo longho; pero faccio fine quanto alla
perspettiua.</p>

Gallant’s Academy</i> (1674).]</p>
</div>


<h4><i>How a Gallant should behaue himself in a Playhouse.</i></h4>

<p>The Theater is your Poets Royal Exchange, vpon which, their Muses (that
are now turnd to Merchants) meeting, barter away that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span> light commodity
of words for a lighter ware then words, <i>Plaudities</i> and the
<i>Breath</i> of the great <i>Beast</i>, which (like the threatnings
of two Cowards) vanish all into aire. <i>Plaiers</i> are their
<i>Factors</i>, who put away the stuffe, and make the best of it they
possibly can (as indeed tis their parts so to doe). Your Gallant, your
Courtier, and your Capten, had wont to be the soundest paymaisters,
and I thinke are still the surest chapmen: and these by meanes that
their heades are well stockt, deale vpon this comical freight by the
grosse: when your <i>Groundling</i>, and <i>Gallery Commoner</i> buyes
his sport by the penny, and, like a <i>Hagler</i>, is glad to vtter it
againe by retailing.</p>

<p>Sithence then the place is so free in entertainment, allowing a stoole
as well to the Farmers sonne as to your Templer: that your Stinkard has
the selfe same libertie to be there in his Tobacco-Fumes, which your
sweet Courtier hath: and that your Car-man and Tinker claime as strong
a voice in their suffrage, and sit to giue iudgement on the plaies life
and death, as well as the prowdest <i>Momus</i> among the tribe of
<i>Critick</i>: It is fit that hee, whom the most tailors bils do make
roome for, when he comes should not be basely (like a vyoll) casd vp in
a corner.</p>

<p>Whether therefore the gatherers of the publique or priuate Playhouse
stand to receiue the after-noones rent, let our Gallant (hauing paid
it) presently aduance himselfe vp to the Throne of the Stage. I meane
not into the Lords roome, (which is now but the Stages Suburbs). No,
those boxes, by the iniquity of custome, conspiracy of waiting-women
and Gentlemen-Ushers, that there sweat together, and the couetousnes of
Sharers, are contemptibly thrust into the reare, and much new Satten
is there dambd by being smothred to death in darknesse. But on the
very Rushes where the Commedy is to daunce, yea and vnder the state
of <i>Cambises</i> himselfe must our fethered <i>Estridge</i>, like a
peece of Ordnance be planted valiantly (because impudently) beating
downe the mewes and hisses of the opposed rascality.</p>

<p>For do but cast vp a reckoning, what large cummings in are pursd vp by
sitting on the Stage. First a conspicuous <i>Eminence</i> is gotten;
by which meanes the best and most essenciall parts of a Gallant (good
cloathes, a proportionable legge, white hand, the Persian lock, and a
tollerable beard) are perfectly reuealed.</p>

<p>By sitting on the stage, you haue a signd pattent to engrosse the whole
commodity of Censure; may lawfully presume to be a Girder: and stand at
the helme to steere the passage of <i>Scænes</i>[;] yet no man shall
once offer to hinder you from obtaining the title of an insolent,
ouer-weening Coxcombe.</p>

<p>By sitting on the stage, you may (without trauelling for it) at the
very next doore, aske whose play it is: and, by that <i>Quest</i> of
<i>inquiry</i>, the law warrants you to auoid much mistaking; if you
know not the author, you may raile against him: and peraduenture so
behaue your selfe, that you may enforce the Author to know you.</p>

<p>By sitting on the stage, if you be a Knight, you may happily get you a
Mistresse: if a mere <i>Fleet street</i> Gentleman, a wife: but assure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
yourselfe by continuall residence, you are the first and principall man
in election to begin the number of <i>We three</i>.</p>

<p>By spreading your body on the stage, and by being a Justice in
examining of plaies, you shall put your selfe into such true
<i>Scænical</i> authority, that some Poet shall not dare to present his
Muse rudely vpon your eyes, without hauing first vnmaskt her, rifled
her, and discouered all her bare and most mysticall parts before you
at a Tauerne, when you most knightly shal for his paines, pay for both
their suppers.</p>

<p>By sitting on the stage, you may (with small cost) purchase the deere
acquaintance of the boyes: haue a good stoole for sixpence: at any
time know what particular part any of the infants present: get your
match lighted, examine the play-suits lace, and perhaps win wagers
vpon laying tis copper, &amp;c. And to conclude whether you be a foole or
a Justice of peace, a Cuckold or a Capten, a Lord Maiors sonne or a
dawcocke, a knaue or an vnder-Sheriffe, of what stamp soeuer you be,
currant or counterfet, the Stage, like time, will bring you to most
perfect light, and lay you open: neither are you to be hunted from
thence though the Scar-crows in the yard, hoot at you, hisse at you,
spit at you, yea throw durt euen in your teeth: tis most Gentlemanlike
patience to endure all this, and to laugh at the silly Animals: but if
the <i>Rabble</i> with a full throat, crie away with the foole, you
were worse then a mad-man to tarry by it: for the Gentleman and the
foole should neuer sit on the Stage together.</p>

<p>Mary let this obseruation go hand in hand with the rest: or rather
like a country-seruing-man, some fiue yards before them. Present not
your selfe on the Stage (especially at a new play) vntill the quaking
prologue hath (by rubbing) got cullor into his cheekes, and is ready to
giue the trumpets their Cue that hees vpon point to enter: for then it
is time, as though you were one of the <i>Properties</i>, or that you
dropt out of the <i>Hangings</i>, to creepe from behind the Arras, with
your <i>Tripos</i> or three-footed stoole in one hand, and a teston
mounted betweene a forefinger and a thumbe in the other: for if you
should bestow your person vpon the vulgar, when the belly of the house
is but halfe full, your apparell is quite eaten vp, the fashion lost,
and the proportion of your body in more danger to be deuoured, then if
it were serued vp in the Counter amongst the Powltry: auoid that as
you would the Bastome. It shall crowne you with rich commendation to
laugh alowd in the middest of the most serious and saddest scene of
the terriblest Tragedy: and to let that clapper (your tongue) be tost
so high that all the house may ring of it: your Lords vse it; your
Knights are Apes to the Lords, and do so too: your Inne-a-court-man is
Zany to the Knights, and (many very scuruily) comes likewise limping
after it: bee thou a beagle to them all, and neuer lin snuffing till
you haue scented them: for by talking and laughing (like a Plough-man
in a Morris) you heap <i>Pelion</i> vpon <i>Ossa</i>, glory vpon glory:
As first, all the eyes in the galleries will leaue walking after the
Players, and onely follow you: the simplest dolt in the house snatches
vp your name, and when he meetes you in the streetes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span> or that you fall
into his hands in the middle of a Watch, his word shall be taken for
you: heele cry, <i>Hees such a Gallant</i>, and you passe. Secondly,
you publish your temperance to the world, in that you seeme not to
resort thither to taste vaine pleasures with a hungrie appetite: but
onely as a Gentleman, to spend a foolish houre or two, because yoe can
doe nothing else. Thirdly you mightily disrelish the Audience, and
disgrace the Author: mary, you take vp (though it be at the worst hand)
a strong opinion of your owne iudgement and inforce the Poet to take
pitty of your weakenesse, and, by some dedicated sonnet to bring you
into a better paradice, onely to stop your mouth.</p>

<p>If you can (either for loue or money) prouide your selfe a lodging
by the water-side: for, aboue the conueniencie it brings, to shun
Shoulder-clapping, and to ship away your Cockatrice betimes in the
morning, it addes a kind of state vnto you, to be carried from thence
to the staires of your Playhouse: hate a Sculler (remember that) worse
then to be acquainted with one ath’ Scullery. No, your Oares are your
onely Sea-crabs, boord them, and take heed you neuer go twice together
with one paire: often shifting is a great credit to Gentlemen; and that
diuiding of your fare wil make the poore watersnaks be ready to pul
you in peeces to enioy your custome: No matter whether vpon landing
you haue money or no, you may swim in twentie of their boates ouer the
riuer upon <i>Ticket</i>: mary, when siluer comes in, remember to pay
trebble their fare, and it will make your Flounder-catchers to send
more thankes after you, when you doe not draw, then when you doe; for
they know, It will be their owne another daie.</p>

<p>Before the Play begins, fall to cardes, you may win or loose (as
<i>Fencers</i> doe in a prize) and beate one another by confederacie,
yet share the money when you meete at supper: notwithstanding, to gul
the <i>Ragga-muffins</i> that stand aloofe gaping at you, throw the
cards (hauing first torne foure or fiue of them) round about the Stage,
iust vpon the third sound, as though you had lost: it skils not if the
foure knaues ly on their backs, and outface the Audience, theres none
such fooles as dare take exceptions at them, because ere the play go
off, better knaues than they will fall into the company.</p>

<p>Now sir, if the writer be a fellow that hath either epigramd you, or
hath had a flirt at your mistris, or hath brought either your feather
or your red beard, or your little legs, &amp;c. on the stage, you shall
disgrace him worse then by tossing him in a blancket, or giuing him the
bastinado in a Tauerne, if, in the middle of his play (bee it Pastoral
or Comedy, Morall or Tragedie), you rise with a skreud and discontented
face from your stoole to be gone: no matter whether the Scenes be
good or no, the better they are the worse do you distast them: and,
beeing on your feet, sneake not away like a coward, but salute all your
gentle acquaintance, that are spred either on the rushes, or on stooles
about you, and draw what troope you can from the stage after you: the
<i>Mimicks</i> are beholden to you, for allowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span> them elbow roome:
their Poet cries perhaps a pox go with you, but care not you for that,
theres no musick without frets.</p>

<p>Mary if either the company, or indisposition of the weather binde you
to sit it out, my counsell is then that you turne plain Ape, take vp
a rush and tickle the earnest eares of your fellow gallants, to make
other fooles fall a laughing: mewe at passionate speeches, blare at
merrie, finde fault with the musicke, whew at the childrens Action,
whistle at the songs: and aboue all, curse the sharers, that whereas
the same day you had bestowed forty shillings on an embrodered Felt and
Feather, (scotch-fashion) for your mistres in the Court, or your punck
in the city, within two houres after, you encounter with the very same
block on the stage, when the haberdasher swore to you the impression
was extant but that morning.</p>

<p>To conclude, hoard vp the finest play-scraps you can get, vpon which
your leane wit may most sauourly feede for want of other stuffe, when
the <i>Arcadian</i> and <i>Euphuisd</i> gentlewomen haue their tongues
sharpened to set vpon you: that qualitie (next to your shittlecocke) is
the onely furniture to a Courtier thats but a new beginner, and is but
in his A B C of complement. The next places that are fild, after the
Playhouses bee emptied, are (or ought to be) Tauernes, into a Tauerne
then let vs next march, where the braines of one Hogshead must be
beaten out to make vp another.</p>

<p>They Acted nothing here but Playes of the holy Scripture, or Saints’
Lives; and that without any certain Theaters or set Companies, till,
about the beginning of Queen Elizabeth’s Reign, they began here first
to assemble into Companies, and set up Theaters, first in the City, (as
in the Inn-yards of the Cross-Keyes, and Bull in Grace and Bishops-Gate
Street at this day is to be seen) till that Fanatick Spirit which
then began with the Stage, and after ended with the Throne, banisht
them thence into the Suburbs, as after they did the Kingdom, in the
beginning of our Civil Wars. In which time, Playes were so little
incompatible with Religion, and the Theater with the Church, as on
Week-dayes after Vespers, both the Children of the Chappel and St.
Pauls Acted Playes, the one in White-Friers, the other behinde the
Convocation-house in Pauls, till people growing more precise, and
Playes more licentious, the Theatre of Pauls was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span> quite supprest,
and that of the Children of the Chappel converted to the use of the
Children of the Revels....</p>

<p>It was the happiness of the Actors of those times to have such Poets
as these to instruct them, and write for them; and no less of those
Poets to have such docile and excellent Actors to Act their Playes,
as a Field and Burbidge; of whom we may say, that he was a delightful
Proteus, so wholly transforming himself into his Part, and putting
off himself with his Cloathes, as he never (not so much as in the
Tyring-house) assum’d himself again until the Play was done: there
being as much difference between him and one of our common Actors, as
between a Ballad-singer who onely mouths it, and an excellent singer,
who knows all his Graces, and can artfully vary and modulate his
Voice, even to know how much breath he is to give to every syllable.
He had all the parts of an excellent Orator (animating his words
with speaking, and Speech with Action) his Auditors being never more
delighted then when he spoke, nor more sorry then when he held his
peace; yet even then, he was an excellent Actor still, never falling
in his Part when he had done speaking; but with his looks and gesture,
maintaining it still unto the heighth, he imagining Age quod agis,
onely spoke to him: so as those who call him a Player do him wrong,
no man being less idle then he, whose whole life is nothing else but
action; with only this difference from other mens, that as what is but
a Play to them, is his Business: so their business is but a play to him.</p>

<p>Now for the difference betwixt our Theaters and those of former times,
they were but plain and simple, with no other Scenes, nor Decorations
of the Stage, but onely old Tapestry, and the Stage strew’d with Rushes
(with their Habits accordingly) whereas ours now for cost and ornament
are arriv’d at the heighth of Magnificence.... For Scenes and Machines
they are no new invention, our Masks and some of our Playes in former
times (though not so ordinary) having had as good or rather better then
any we have now.</p>

<p><i>Truman.</i> I say, the actors that I have seen, before the Wars,
Lowin, Taylor, Pollard, and some others, were almost as far beyond Hart
and his company; as those were, beyond these now in being....</p>

<p><i>Lovewit.</i> Pray, Sir, what master-parts can you remember the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
‘Blackfriars’ men to act, in Johnson’s, Shakespeare’s, and Fletcher’s
plays?</p>

<p><i>Truman.</i> What I can at present recollect I’ll tell you.
Shakespeare (who, as I have heard, was a much better Poet than Player),
Burbage, Hemmings, and others of the older sort, were dead before I
knew the Town. But, in my time, before the Wars; Lowin used to act,
with mighty applause, Falstaff; Morose; Vulpone; and Mammon in the
<i>Alchemist</i>; Melancius in the <i>Maid’s tragedy</i>. And at the
same time, Amyntor was played by Stephen Hammerton: who was, at first,
a most noted and beautiful Woman-Actor; but afterwards he acted, with
equal grace and applause, a young lover’s part.</p>

<p>Taylor acted Hamlet incomparably well; Jago; Truewit, in the <i>Silent
Woman</i>; and Face, in the <i>Alchemist</i>.</p>

<p>Swanston used to play Othello.</p>

<p>Pollard and Robinson were Comedians. So was Shank; who used to act Sir
Roger in the <i>Scornful Lady</i>. These were of the ‘Blackfriars’....</p>

<p><i>Truman.</i> Before the Wars, there were in being, all these Play
Houses at the same time.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="hangingindent">The ‘Blackfriars’ and ‘Globe’ on the Bankside. A winter, and
summer house belonging to the same Company; called ‘The King’s
Servants’.</p>

<p class="hangingindent">The ‘Cockpit’ or ‘Phoenix’ in Drury Lane; called ‘The Queen’s
Servants’.</p>

<p class="hangingindent">The Private House in Salisbury Court; called ‘The Prince’s
Servants’.</p>

<p class="hangingindent">The ‘Fortune’ near White Cross Street: and the ‘Red Bull’ at
the upper end of St. John’s Street. The two last were mostly
frequented by citizens, and the meaner sort of people.</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">All these Companies got money, and lived in reputation: especially
those of the ‘Blackfriars’, who were men of grave and sober behaviour.</p>

<p><i>Lovewit.</i> Which I much admire at. That the Town, much less than
at present, could then maintain Five Companies; and yet now Two can
hardly subsist.</p>

<p><i>Truman.</i> Do not wonder, but consider! That though the Town was
then, perhaps, not much more than half so populous as now; yet then the
prices were small (there being no scenes), and better order kept among
the company that came: which made very good people think a play an
innocent diversion for an idle hour or two; the plays being then, for
the most part, more instructive and moral.... It is an argument of the
worth of the Plays and Actors of the last Age, and easily inferred that
they were much beyond ours in this, to consider that they could support
themselves merely from their own merit, the weight of the matter, and
goodness of the action; without scenes and machines....</p>

<p><i>Lovewit.</i> I have read of one Edward Alleyn.... Was he one of the
‘Blackfriars’?</p>

<p><i>Truman.</i> Never, as I have heard; for he was dead before my time.
He was Master of a Company of his own; for whom he built<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span> the ‘Fortune’
playhouse from the ground: a large round brick building....</p>

<p><i>Lovewit.</i> What kind of Playhouses had they before the Wars?</p>

<p><i>Truman.</i> The ‘Blackfriars’, ‘Cockpit’, and ‘Salisbury Court’
were called Private Houses; and were very small to what we see now.
The ‘Cockpit’ was standing since the Restoration; and Rhodes’s Company
acted there for some time.</p>

<p><i>Lovewit.</i> I have seen that.</p>

<p><i>Truman.</i> Then you have seen the other two, in effect; for they
were all three built almost exactly alike, for form and bigness. Here
they had ‘Pits’ for the gentry, and acted by candlelight.</p>

<p>The ‘Globe’, ‘Fortune’, and ‘Bull’ were large houses, and lay partly
open to the weather: and there they always acted by daylight....</p>

<p><i>Truman.</i> Plays were frequently acted by Choristers and Singing
Boys; and several of our old Comedies have printed in the title-page,
Acted by the Children of Paul’s (not the School, but the Church);
others, By the Children of Her Majesty’s Chapel. In particular,
<i>Cynthia’s Revels</i> and the <i>Poetaster</i> were played by them;
who were, at that time, famous for good action.... Some of the Chapel
Boys, when they grew men, became Actors at the ‘Blackfriars’. Such were
Nathan Field and John Underwood.</p>

<p>A performance was given before Elizabeth at Ch. Ch., Oxford,
on 24 Sept. 1592, with a prologue and epilogue by Gager, which
are printed with his <i>Meleager</i>. But the play was not new,
for Sir John Harington, who records the 1592 performance in his
<i>Metamorphosis of Ajax</i> (1596), 127, had already named
‘the Oxford Bellum Grammaticale’ as ‘full of harmeles myrth’ in
his <i>Apologie of Poetrie</i> (1591). The ‘Master Spense’ of
the S. R. entry may be a confusion with the publisher’s name.
Wood, <i>Ath. Oxon.</i> ii. 533, was told by Richard Gardiner of
Ch. Ch. that the author was Leonard Hutten, who took his B.A.
from Ch. Ch. in 1578, and his M.A. in 1582. He was known as a
dramatist by 26 Sept. 1583, when Gager wrote of him (Boas, 256),</p>

<p>The production is assigned by Fuller, <i>Hist. of Cambridge</i>
(ed. Nichols), 217, to a visit by the Earl of Essex to Cambridge
as Chancellor of the University in 1597–8. Moore Smith has,
however, shown that it almost certainly belongs to an earlier
visit, and took place at Queens’ College on 1 March 1595. The
chief evidence is the reference in Rowland Whyte’s account of
the <i>Device</i> by Essex or Bacon (q.v.) for 17 Nov. 1595 to
‘Giraldy’ and ‘Pedantiq’, as played at Cambridge. These may
fairly be taken to be the Gerardus and the pedant Petrus of
<i>Laelia</i>. The actors of these two parts are identified with
George Meriton and George Mountaine, Fellows of Queens’, by John
Weever, <i>Epigrammes</i> (1599), iv. 19.</p>

<p>Conceivably this may also attribute authorship of the play and

<p>The introductory line, ‘Ante quater denos vixi Pedantius
annos’,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span> suggests production in 1591, but the play cannot
have been very recent when Sir John Harington, in a note
to his translation of <i>Orlando Furioso</i> (1591), Bk.
xiv, cited a ‘pretie conceit’ of ‘our Cambridge Comedie
Pedantius (at whiche I remember the noble Earle of Essex that
now is, was present)’. In his <i>Apologie of Poetrie</i>,
prefixed to the translation, Harington also says (G. Smith,
<i>Elizabethan Critical Essays</i>, ii. 210), ‘How full of
harmeles myrth is our Cambridge <i>Pedantius</i>? and the
Oxford <i>Bellum Grammaticale</i>?’ Harington, who again cites
‘our <i>Pedantius</i> of Cambridge’ in his <i>Metamorphosis
of Ajax</i> (1596), 126, was with Essex at Cambridge during
1578–81, and Moore Smith has shown that the production at
Trinity was probably on 6 Feb. 1581, shortly before the defeat
of Gabriel Harvey by Anthony Wingfield of Trinity for the
Public Oratorship of Cambridge. There can be little doubt
that Harvey was the butt of <i>Pedantius</i>, and hardly more
that Wingfield was concerned in this satire. Nashe has two
allusions to the matter. In <i>Strange News</i> (1593) he
says that Harvey’s verses were ‘miserably flouted at in M.
<i>Winkfields</i> Comoedie of <i>Pedantius</i> in Trinitie
Colledge’ (<i>Works</i>, i. 303). In <i>Have With You to
Saffron-Walden</i> (1596) he says, ‘Ile fetch him aloft in
Pedantius, that exquisite Comedie in Trinitie Colledge; where,
vnder the cheife part, from which it tooke his name, as namely
the concise and firking finicaldo fine School-master, hee was
full drawen &amp; delineated from the soale of the foote to the
crowne of his head’, and goes on to enumerate the principal
traits of Harvey touched off by the actors, who ‘borrowed
his gowne to playe the Part in, the more to flout him’
(<i>Works</i>, iii. 80). So far, we are left a little uncertain
whether the main authorship is to be ascribed, with Nashe in
<i>Strange News</i>, to Anthony Wingfield, or, with the <i>Caius
MS.</i>, to Edward Forsett, both of whom were Fellows of Trinity
in 1581. Moore Smith has, however, shown in <i>T. L. S.</i>
(10 Oct. 1918) that Forsett refers to ‘Pedantio meo’ in the
epistle to an unprinted <i>Concio</i> of his among the MSS.
of St. John’s, Cambridge. For an absurd attempt to assign the
authorship to Bacon, largely on the ground of some non-existent
pigs in the title-page border, cf. E. A. [E. G. Harman], <i>The
Shakespeare Problem</i> (1909), and <i>T. L. S.</i> (27 March,
17 April, 1 May, 1919). Modern ascriptions to Thomas Beard and
to Walter Hawkesworth seem to rest on misunderstandings.</p>

<p>[<i>Preliminary Note.</i>&mdash;This is a chronological abstract
of plays, printed or entered for printing in the Stationers’
Register, of which either the entry or the possible date of
production falls in 1558–1616. Some of the later plays are only
included in deference to the conjectures of others as to their
early origin in whole or in part. The list is little more than
an index; details must be sought in chh. xxiii and xxiv. I think
it is nearly self-explanatory. The plays marked T. in col. 1 are
those of which the first entry in the Register is in connexion
with a transfer of copyright; the name in col. 4 is then that
of the transferrer. Titles of non-extant plays are marked with
inverted commas in col. 3; some of them (cf. App. M) may not
really relate to plays at all. The symbol (s) in col. 6 is used
where the imprint indicates, not that a play is printed ‘for’ a
stationer, but that it is ‘to be sold by’ a stationer; it is not
quite clear how far the two formulae are equivalent. The most
important notes in col. 7 are those in italics, which indicate
direct evidence afforded by the entry or first title-page as
to companies by which the plays had been acted. I have added
from other sources additional ascriptions which seem certain
or reasonably probable, and sometimes omitted even title-page
evidence where it obviously relates to production by a company
of later origin than 1616. The notes in col. 8 must not be
taken as attributions of authorship, but merely as guides to
the relevant sections in ch. xxiii or to ch. xxiv. The brackets
in this column indicate that the plays, being pre-Elizabethan,
are dealt with in App. X of <i>The Mediaeval Stage</i>. Some
statistics, based on this list, of the output of plays from the
Elizabethan press, will be found in ch. xxii.]</p>

<p>[<i>Bibliographical Note.</i>&mdash;As unknown prints have turned up
in the sale of an Irish collection (1907) and the Mostyn sale
(1919), and others may yet turn up from time to time, I give a
list of plays as to the existence or preparation for publication
of which there is some evidence. These are mainly taken
either from the Stationers’ Register or from the publishers’
advertisement lists (Rogers and Ley’s in 1656, Archer’s in
1656, Kirkman’s in 1661 and 1671), analysed by W. W. Greg in an
appendix to his <i>Masques</i> (1902). One is included in Sir
John Harington’s catalogue of his library of plays apparently
compiled in 1610 (cf. ch. xxii). Probably some of the registered
titles, in which the description ‘play’ or ‘interlude’ is not
used, do not relate to plays at all. I might have added a few
more of this type from A. Esdaile, <i>List of English Tales and
Romances</i> (1912, <i>Bibl. Soc.</i>), xxxiii. And it must be
borne in mind that registration is not proof of publication.
In particular, it is pretty clear that the two long series of
entries by Humphrey Moseley on 9 Sept. 1653 and 29 June 1660,
from which I have taken those conceivably relating to pre-1616
work, represent unaccomplished enterprises. They are fully
discussed in W. W. Greg, <i>The Bakings of Betsy</i> (1911,
<i>3 Library</i>, ii. 225), together with John Warburton’s
(<i>ob.</i> 1759) list in <i>Lansd. MS.</i> 807, f. 1, of plays
which he claims to have possessed in MS., until ‘through my
own carelesness and the ignorance of my ser[vant] in whose
hands I had lodgd them they was unluckely burnd or put under
Pye bottoms’. As this list is evidently in some way related to
Moseley’s entries, I have, for the sake of completeness, cited a
few titles which it adds.]</p>

<p><i>A Bad Beginning Makes a Good Ending.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

</div>

<p><i>Adam’s Tragedy.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>S. R.</i> 1608, March 26 (Pasfield). ‘A book called Adams
tragedie.’ <i>W. White</i> (Arber, iii. 372).</p>

<p>This is not likely to have been a play.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Antonio and Vallia.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Tragedy in Archer’s list.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Belinus.</i></p>

<p><i>Brennus.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sir John Harington’s catalogue of his plays in 1610 (7 <i>N.
Q.</i> ix. 382) includes ‘Belynus, Brennus’. This might
represent either two plays or one.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[399]</span></p>

<p><i>Bonos Nochios.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>S. R.</i> 1609, Jan. 27 (Segar). ‘An enterlude called Bonos
Nochios.’ <i>Charlton</i> (Arber, iii. 400).</p>
</div>

<p><i>Cardenio.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ascribed to Shakespeare (q.v.) and Fletcher.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Celestina.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>S. R.</i> 1598, Oct. 5. ‘A booke intituled The tragicke
Comedye of Celestina, wherein are discoursed in most pleasant
stile manye Philosophicall sentences and advertisementes verye
necessarye for younge gentlemen Discoveringe the sleightes
of treacherous servantes and the subtile cariages of filthye
bawdes.’ <i>William Aspley</i> (Arber, iii. 127).</p>

<p>This was doubtless, like the earlier <i>Calisto and Meliboea</i>
(<i>Mediaeval Stage</i>, ii. 455) and James Mabbe’s
<i>The Spanish Bawd</i> (1631), a version of the Spanish
<i>Celestina</i> (1499) of Fernando de Rojas, but it can hardly
have been Mabbe’s, which was entered in S. R. on 27 Feb. 1630,
while Mabbe, although born in 1572, is first heard of as a
writer in 1611, and appears to have turned his attention to
things Spanish as a result of a visit to Spain in that year.</p>
</div>

<p><i>1 Chinon of England.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>S. R.</i> 1596, Jan. 20. ‘The ffirste parte of the famous
historye of Chinan of England.’ <i>T. Gosson and Danter</i>
(Arber, iii. 57).</p>

<p>The Admiral’s produced ‘Chinone of Ingland’ as a new play on
3 Jan. 1596. Greg, ii. 178, is probably right in relating the
S. R. entry to Christopher Middleton’s romance, <i>The Famous
Historie of Chinon of England</i>, printed by Danter for
Cuthbert Burby in 1597. But ‘Chinon of England’ is in Rogers and
Ley’s list.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Cleopatra.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>An unascribed ‘Cleopatra’, in addition to the plays of Daniel
(q.v.) and May, is in Rogers and Ley’s list.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Cloth Breeches and Velvet Hose.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>S. R.</i> 1600, May 27. ‘A morall of Clothe breches and
veluet hose, As yt is acted by my lord Chamberlens servantes.’
<i>Roberts</i> (Arber, iii. 161).</p>

<p>This is one of the plays stayed by a note in the Register on the
same day (cf. ch. xxii).</p>
</div>

<p><i>College of Canonical Clerks.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>S. R.</i> 1566–7. ‘An interlude named the Colledge of
canonycall clerkes.’ <i>John Charlewod</i> (Arber, i. 335).</p>
</div>

<p><i>Craft Upon Subtlety’s Back.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>S. R.</i> 1609, Jan. 27 (Segar). ‘An enterlude called, Crafte
vppon Subtiltyes backe.’ <i>Charlton</i> (Arber, iii. 400).</p>
</div>

<p><i>Crafty Cromwell.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A tragi-comedy in Kirkman’s list of 1661. Greg, <i>Masques</i>,
lx, thinks it may be a duplicate entry of <i>Cromwell’s
Conspiracy</i> (1660).</p>
</div>

<p><i>Destruction of Jerusalem.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>By Legge (q.v.).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[400]</span></p>

<p><i>Duke Humphrey.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ascribed to Shakespeare (q.v.).</p>
</div>

<p><i>English Arcadia.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A comedy in Archer’s list, but probably, as suggested by Greg,
<i>Masques</i>, lxv, an error for Gervase Markham’s romance
(1607, 1613) of that name.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Eunuchus.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>By Kyffyn (q.v.)?</p>
</div>

<p><i>Faithful Friends.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ascribed to Beaumont (q.v.) and Fletcher.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Far Fetched and Dear Bought is Good for Ladies.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>S. R.</i> 1566–7. ‘A playe intituled farre fetched and deare
bowght ys good for lades.’ <i>Thomas Hackett</i> (Arber, i. 331).</p>
</div>

<p><i>Fatal Love.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ascribed to Chapman (q.v.).</p>
</div>

<p><i>Fortune.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>S. R.</i> 1566–7. ‘A playe of Fortune to know eche one hyr
conditions and gentle manours aswell of Women as of men &amp;c.’
<i>Thomas Purfoote</i> (Arber, i. 332).</p>

<p>Collier, <i>Stationers’ Registers</i>, i. 155, suggested that
this was a ‘lottery, or game’, not an interlude, and this
receives support from a transfer of his father’s copies to
Purfoot’s son on 6 Nov. 1615 (Arber, iii. 576), which includes
‘The little booke of Fortune with pictures’.</p>
</div>

<p><i>George Scanderbeg.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>S. R.</i> 1601, July 3. ‘The true historye of George
Scanderbarge as yt was lately playd by the right honorable the
Earle of Oxenforde his servantes.’ <i>E. Allde</i> (Arber, iii.
187).</p>

<p>There seems no adequate reason for ascribing this to Marlowe
(q.v.) or Nashe.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Give a Man Luck and Throw him into the Sea.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>S. R.</i> 1600, July 24. ‘Two plaies or thinges ... the other
gyve a man luck and throw him into the sea.’ <i>Oliffe</i>
(Arber, iii. 168).</p>
</div>

<p><i>Godfrey of Bulloigne.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>See Heywood, <i>Four Prentices of London</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><i>God Speed the Plough.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>S. R.</i> 1601, March 1. ‘A booke called God spede the
ploughe.’ <i>Harrison</i> (Arber, iii. 180).</p>

<p>This is not necessarily the play acted by Sussex’s men for
Henslowe in Dec. 1593 (ch. xiii), or indeed a play at all.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Guise.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Entered in Rogers and Ley’s list as by Marston (q.v.), in
Archer’s as a comedy by Webster (q.v.), and in Kirkman’s of 1661
and 1671 without ascription; that of 1671 calls it a tragedy.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Gustavus, King of Swethland.</i></p>

<p><i>Heliogabalus.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>S. R.</i> 1594, June 19. ‘An ... enterlude of the lyfe and
deathe of Heliogabilus.’ <i>Danter</i> (Arber, ii. 654).</p>

<p>Can this be the play on ‘the mad priest of the Sun’ apparently
referred to by Greene (q.v.) in <i>Perimides</i> (1588)?</p>
</div>

<p><i>Hemidos and Thelay.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>S. R.</i> 1569–70. ‘A boke intituled the Rufful tragedy of
Hemidos and Thelay by Rychard Robynson.’ <i>Henry Bynneman</i>
(Arber, i. 411).</p>

<p>Probably not a play.</p>

Jesuytes Commedie. Acted at Lyons in Fraunce the 7 and 8 of
August 1607.’ <i>Allde and Johnson</i> (Arber, iii. 361).</p>

<p>Probably only a narrative of this famous performance; cf. ch. x.</p>

his Conquest of Spaine and marriage of his Twoo daughters to the
Kinges of Castile and Portugale &amp;c.’ <i>E. White</i> (Arber, ii.
649).</p>

<p>Probably not a play but the chap-book source of that begun by
Hathway (q.v.) and Rankins for the Admiral’s in 1601 (cf. Greg,
<i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 216). Arber, v. 176, however, describes it
as a play printed for White by Islip.</p>

<p>In Rogers and Ley’s list; presumably identical with the comedy

<p><i>Mother Rumming.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A comedy in Archer’s list. Greg, <i>Masques</i>, xc, suggests
an error for T. Thompson’s late <i>Mother Shipton</i>, which
Archer omits. Elinor Rumming, however, might well have made a
play-theme.</p>
</div>

<p><i>The Netherlands.</i></p>

<p><i>S. R.</i> 1595, May 10. ‘The tragedie of Ninus and Semiramis,

<p><i>The Queen.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A tragedy in Archer’s list. Fletcher’s name is given, but Greg,
<i>Masques</i>, c, says this has ‘crept in from another entry’.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Richard Whittington.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>S. R.</i> 1605, Feb. 8. ‘The history of Richard Whittington
of his lowe byrthe, his great fortune, as yt was plaid by the
prynces servantes.’ <i>Pavier</i> (Arber, iii. 282).</p>

<p>The play is referred to in <i>K. B. P.</i> ind. 22.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Robin Hood and Little John.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>S. R.</i> 1594, May 14. ‘A booke entituled a pastorall
plesant Commedie of Robin Hood and Little John.’ <i>Islip</i>
(Arber, ii. 649).</p>

<p>Arber, v. 176, describes the play as printed by Islip for E.
White, to whom the copy was passed by a cancel. It appears
in Rogers and Ley’s and Archer’s lists of 1656. Greg,
<i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 190, finds an allusion to its ‘merry jests’
in Munday’s <i>Downfall of Robin Hood</i>, iv. 2.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[403]</span></p>

<p><i>Rufus I.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>S. R.</i> 1595, Nov. 24. ‘A booke intituled The true
tragicall historie of kinge Rufus the First with the life and
deathe of Belyn Dun the first thief that ever was hanged in
England.’ <i>W. Blackwell</i> (Arber, iii. 54).</p>

<p>Greg, <i>Henslowe</i>, ii. 164, thinks this the <i>Bellendon</i>
played as a new piece by the Admiral’s and Chamberlain’s for
Henslowe on 10 June 1594 (cf. ch. xiii). The title curiously
resembles that of another book, probably, as Greg suggests, a
chap-book, entered in S. R. by T. Gosson on 17 May 1594 as ‘a
book intituled The famous Cronicle of Henrye the First, with the
life and death of Bellin Dunn the firste thief that ever was
hanged in England’ (Arber, ii. 650). Perhaps this was the source
of the play.</p>
</div>

<p><i>A Sackful of News.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>S. R.</i> 1557–8. ‘These bokes folowynge called ... a sacke
full of newes.’ <i>J. King</i> (Arber, i. 75).</p>

<p>1582, Jan. 15. Transfer from S. Awdeley to John Charlwood
(Arber, ii. 405).</p>

<p>1586, Sept. 5. ‘A sackfull of newes, beinge an old copie: whiche
the said Edward is ordered to haue printed by Abell Jeffes.’
<i>Edward White</i> (Arber, ii. 456).</p>

<p>This is less likely to have been the ‘lewd’ play suppressed at
the Boar’s Head, Aldgate, in Aug. 1557 (<i>Mediaeval Stage</i>,
ii. 223) than the jest-book known to Captain Cox in 1575 (F. J.
Furnivall, <i>Laneham’s Letter</i>, lxvi. 30) and printed from
the earliest extant edition of 1673 by W. C. Hazlitt, <i>Old

<p>[<i>Bibliographical Note.</i>&mdash;This list includes only English
texts. Most of the Latin plays (cf. App. K) also exist in MS.
The English ones so preserved are generally of an academic
type; on the general character of the few that are of playhouse
origin, cf. ch. xxii. Of the fifteen play texts collected in
<i>Egerton MS.</i> 1994, only three appear to be of plays
written before 1616; descriptions of this collection are in
A. H. Bullen, <i>O. E. P.</i> ii. 417, and F. S. Boas, <i>A
Seventeenth-Century Theatrical Repertoire</i> (<i>3 Library</i>,
July 1917). In addition to the plays named below, there are a
<i>Pelopidarum Secunda</i> in <i>Harleian MS.</i> 5110, which
may be of any date in the first half of the seventeenth century,
and a Welsh ‘enterlut’, dated 1584 and without ascription or
title in <i>Peniarth MS.</i> 68 (<i>H. M. C. Welsh MSS.</i> i.
2. 467). A full account of the Plots (‘plott’ ‘plotte’, ‘platt’)
is given, with the seven texts, by Greg, <i>Henslowe Papers</i>,
127. They have sometimes been taken for ‘<i>scenarie</i>’ of
impromptu plays, like the Italian ‘Commedie dell’arte’, although
one of them is for the extant <i>Battle of Alcazar</i>; but
they were probably for the use of the ‘bookholder’ or the
‘tireman’, and consist of skeleton outlines of the action,
with notes of entrances and exits, and of the points at which
properties and music are required. The names of the dramatis
personae are generally accompanied by those of the actors who
represented them. The paper on which they are written is mounted
on pasteboard, and a hole cut near the top probably served to
suspend them on a peg in the playhouse. All seven probably
belong to companies (Strange’s and Admiral’s) with which
Edward Alleyn was connected. One was utilized for the cover of
a Dulwich MS., and G. Steevens, who once owned three of the
others, found ‘reason to suppose that these curiosities once
belonged to the collection of Alleyn’.]</p>

<h2>INDEXES</h2>
</div>


<p>These indexes are selective, not exhaustive. That of <i>Plays</i>
is, I hope, full. Classical and foreign plays, including plays given
by English players abroad, but not Latin plays written in England,
are printed in italics; plays not clearly extant in inverted commas.
Translations and fragmentary texts are indicated by ‘tr.’ and ‘fr.’
respectively, and compositions not properly to be classed as plays
are also noted. Duplicate titles which might cause confusion are
distinguished by dates or authorship. References to the main notices,
in vol. iii, pp. 201–518, and vol. iv, pp. 1–74, and occasionally
elsewhere, of plays belonging or conjecturally assigned to the period
1558–1616 are printed in blacker type. Titles are shortened by the
omission of such words as ‘A’, ‘The’, ‘King’, and cross-references
are only given from the better-known alternative titles. The index of
<i>Persons</i> gives those connected with the Court and with stage
affairs, other as a rule than the players and playwrights, who are
alphabetically arranged in chh. xv and xxiii respectively. The index of
<i>Places</i> includes, besides London localities, all those recorded
in Appendix A as visited by Elizabeth, but not, unless for some special
reason, those at which travelling players performed. In the index of
<i>Subjects</i> inverted commas are used for technical terms and for
ordinary objects as represented on the stage.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
